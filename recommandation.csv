Roamright,Do not use Aon from carnival 5 weeks still waiting for answer  I have made numerous phone calls and just keep getting the run around trying to get a refund,1
Roamright,Excellent response to.my request for quotes for an upcoming family vacation.  Rates very reasonable and was impressed our children were covered for free.  I will definitely suggest this company to others.,5
Roamright,"Arch Insurance is a professional company with great team to service customer.The team members I have contacted are very helpful, warm and professional.It all makes me feel that I can  trust Arch.Many Thanks,Molly",5
Roamright,"Kim, in her pleasant way, streamlined the entire process and explained in detail why my claim was denied.Aside from the customer service experience, this company is like most insurance companies. Their mission is to make money not to settle claims in favor of insurers. TVLC161016224.",5
Roamright,"Our comfort level traveling during the holidays, bad weather, plane delays and with heavy travel season !",5
Roamright,They are insuring customers for hazards they may not have other insurance options available.  Most people are unaware that their primary health insurance in the US will not cover many illnesses or injuries sustained outside of the U. S.,4
Roamright,"My name is Neal  In error I wrote down wrong account number for reimbursement to be put in my checking account for my wife Barbara . I spoke to numerous people who couldn’t solve the problem. I spoke to Betsy who then put me through to. Monica who spoke at length to me and told me she would get to the bottom to get my refund. Last night I looked at my account and the reimbursement was there under my name instead.I called this morning to let Monica know everything was done, Monica contacted me and spoke to Barbara, who told her we had received reimbursement.Monica is an asset to your company and we were very impressed with her concern and professionalism.",5
Roamright,"My wife was sick during our trip and required medical care, RoamRight paid the claim quickly with minimal documentation",5
Roamright,"Good coverage but inadequate medical limits. I was told that the senior medical limit would be increased to $100,000.Do I have to go to AIG?The portal does not handle renewal trips well. Why do I have to start over for each new trip",4
Roamright,"We travel quite frequently with Backroads Cycling trips and Arch RoamRight is their main travel insurance company.  So when my wife had a minor accident in Mallorca we filed a claim with Arch RoamRight. The claim was handled promptly and to our satisfaction. I then had to contact Arch RoamRight regards a couple of matters relating to address changes etc. The customer service people I dealt with were friendly, helpful and had positive attitudes. Rozel who was my primary contact and her supervisor Monica were exceptional people. My kudos to ArchRoamRight for having such employees in their company.",5
Roamright,"I had to fly home from my cruise due to my father passing away.  The documentation they request is ridiculous.  I have sent a death certificate, obituary, receipts and now they want his admission records to the hospital.  They even asked for an attending physicians report. Very frustrating!I just received this email from them today…Today at 10:44 AM vGood morning,Thank you for your email, Unfortunately without additional medical information we are unable to accurately process your claim, We cannot use his passing as the reason for the claim as it did not occur until you returned home. We cannot use the current medical information provided as the admission occurred prior to your departure therefore the illness unforeseen.We will need the records to confirm if a new illness first appeared after your departure but prior to returning home in order to review.Kind Regards,",1
Roamright,"Max was so good at explaining all options  in very simple terms. He got the quotes to me in a timely fashion. With his knowledge on travel insurance , I thought he was a seasoned representative but he has only been with the company 3 months. Very impressive young man and hoping he can help me finalize my insurance contract . Thank you . Pamela Moise",5
Roamright,"We had a wonderful experience with Arch RoamRight last year when we got Covid while travelling in Europe and had to cancel our Backroads trip. The first thing I thought of even before finalizing our trip booking today was buying travel insurance from you again. The agent I spoke to today was extremely helpful. The process is transparent and user friendly. Exactly what I needed. Once we purchase the coverage, we won’t have to think of this again. It will mean the trip went well and we didn’t need to file a claim.",5
Roamright,Agents always are able to answer questions quickly and offer travel insurance policy choices.  RoamRight also gave vouchers for cancelled trip.,5
Roamright,"Customer service is friendly, helpful and transparent. Everything they told me proved to be true, whichever agent I spoke with provided guidance and advice in a friendly manner. Wait time to speak with a rep was never more than a minute. Definitely provided relief during an uncomfortable situation",5
Roamright,Very knowledgeable representative.  Answered all of my questions and then some!,5
Roamright,"I have used RoamRight for at least 3 different trips that required travel insurance. Last trip My husband and I decided it was a good idea to have in case of a medical emergency and for other coverage as well. Our experience has been very easy to deal with the agents and purchase a policy, nothing was complicated. That being said, we have never had to make a claim, so that might be a totally different experience.",4
Roamright,Even in wars and political instability - they will not cover. Buyer Beware.Buy from Insurance with no questions asked.,1
Roamright,"We paid Rom Right premium  in full when we paid for our trip, long in advance of departure to cover preexisting conditions. After trip was cancelled because of Covid danger, we received a refund from Roam Right for less than half our payment, essentially because we were “covered” for the period prior to our departure. We were covered for what, I question. This us why people question the value of trip insurance",1
Roamright,Had to file 3 separate claims for lost/delayed luggage. Was able to speak to a live person when I needed to. Paid in a timely manner,5
Roamright,She listened to me and finally verified that my documents were good for my claim so hopefully she us correct. She also is going out if her way to help my traveling partner who us also having trouble getting a document frim the airline.,5
Roamright,After being a loyal client for several trips/years for the first time ever we had to cancel our trip and request a claim payment as per the specifics of our policy. Approval process was exceptionally slow and drawn out.  Review process made us feel as we were dishonest and had made multiple claims in the past which which never did.  They process your payment for a policy in light speed and pay out a claim for less than one-third of the policy fee in glacier speed.  Their multiple level claim review process is archaic and insulting.,3
Roamright,"I did not need the insurance in this trip, but last year on a bike trip to Vietnam and Cambodia, I had an accident. RoamRight went above and beyond in getting me to a good hospital, covering my surgery, and getting me home safely.  I can’t say enough good things about what a great service this is.",5
Roamright,"I’m a 100% service connected disabled veteran US Marine, medically retired from US federal employment (27yrs) and social security disabled. I injured my back before trip and Arch insurance denied my claim. Although I provided doctor notes, letters and VA disability letter. I realized no matter what I provided this insurance company, it was predetermined to deny claim. I checked the Better Business Bureau and found many similar complaints. A shameful way to treat a war veteran and my wife a nurse who retired from the VA, caring for the most ill and injured veterans. We travel every few months around the world and share are experiences with family, friends and coworkers. A fact that doesn’t seem to concern the company. I only wish I would have checked the Better Business Bureau first but it is a lesson learned. Buyer beware.",1
Roamright,"I cannot BELIEVE that an insurance company is that commented to their consumers with respect, understanding, patient along with keeping a great rapport of knowledge. This {ARCH ROAMRIGHT} company was the EASIEST, SPOT ON WITH REAL INFORMATION AND WHAT TO EXPECT! Darlene was excellent. This was one call I didn't feel lost! EVER! WTG TEAM and Thanks",5
Roamright,"Always hate paying extra charges; however, we will never consider Travel Insurance extra, only necessary. After planning a trip to Alaska to celebrate our 50th Anniversary, my husband had an accident 2 weeks prior to departure. He was not going to be able to walk well to endure the trip nor enjoy this once in a lifetime event. We notified the travel agency and filed a claim with Arch Travel Insurance after receiving information from the travel agency. Once information was filed online, a decision was made within a few days to close the claim. We received a complete refund from the travel Agency and Arch Travel Insurance minus the cost of the travel insurance. We are relieved, thankful and grateful for the coverage. Thank you Arch Travel Insurance! H. Furr & wife.",5
Roamright,"Do not use this travel insurance.  They are quite well available to take your money when acquiring an insurance package, but forget about submitting a claim.  They probably have bots running process.  I tried communicating thru email several times, and then called but couldn't get connected to a claims human.  The person I did get hold of did not know what to do and couldn't even pass on the information.  shortly after the call, they closed my claim!!New edit:Arch roamright responded to this bad review but they have NOT responded to me.  I have attempted to contact them but have been unable.Again, DO NOT USE THIS INSURANCE ORGANIZATION!!",1
Roamright,"I recently chose Arch RoamRight for my travel insurance needs, and the experience exceeded my expectations. The website, offers a user-friendly interface, making it easy to explore and customize coverage options based on my travel plans.Arch RoamRight's commitment to transparency is evident in their clear and comprehensive coverage details. I found a suitable plan that provided peace of mind for my trip. The pricing was reasonable, considering the extensive protection offered.What truly sets Arch RoamRight apart is their exceptional customer service. The support team was knowledgeable, responsive, and assisted me in understanding the nuances of my chosen coverage. This level of service gave me confidence in my decision.During my travels, I encountered an unforeseen situation, and I had to file a claim. Arch RoamRight's claims process was efficient, and they promptly addressed and resolved my claim. This experience reinforced my trust in their commitment to customer satisfaction.I highly recommend Arch RoamRight to fellow travelers seeking reliable and customer-centric travel insurance. Their seamless online experience, transparent policies, and outstanding support make them a top choice in the industry.",5
Roamright,We had travel insurance for our Alaskan cruise trip.  Coming home on way to airport we were informed our flight was cancelled.  No other flights that day on the booked airline. They booked us for a flight for next afternoon.  We booked a flight on another airline. Trip delay caused expenses.  Filed claim 6 months ago. Terrible customer service.  It's still an outstanding claim. I've had to submit same forms 3-4 times.,1
Roamright,"It’s not we thought the coverage wasDifficult to file a claim, our claim was denied more than twice .We did not have problems with Allianz insurance. We decided to go back and bought a year coverage.",2
Roamright,"I filed a claim on 11/11/2022 and it took almost five weeks for it to be processed although they stated that it will take 30 days max. On 12/16/2022 I received an email that my claim was approved and a letter stating that the payment has been made with the transaction reference number on it. To my surprise up to date, the payment it's not yet sent, and after several phone calls and emails I'm send from one pillar to another without clear explanation. The claiming process it's horrible with unprofessional staff like SAMANTHA. They rarely reply to my emails. So disappointing and very annoyed with this company.",1
Roamright,"I always use Roamright for my international travel.   I fortunately have never had a travel issue that resulted in a claim, but obtaining a quote and policy is so quick and easy.   And the peace of mind having toll free access to assistance is invaluable.",5
Roamright,I felt pretty well protected in the event of calamity.  I was however misguided thinking I had until like 30 days before the trip to purchase “insurance” . I wish the website was a little easier to navigate on discovery info. I have purchased Roam Right on prior trips but couldn’t remember when or if I purchased cancel insurance. All went well and we had a safe trip,5
Roamright,RoamRight was efficient at  getting back to me. All information they asked me I provided. I had my doctor send them a filled out form that they requested. I filled out all their forms they requested. And they still have not addressed my issue from a trip that I never was able to go on. This has been over a month of e mails back and forth.Very frustrated. I have used them numerous times but never had to make a claim . This claim was only for $360 bkz I was honest and found someone to take my place. I travel monthly and will not use them again.,2
Roamright,I filed a claim about a week ago and thought I did something incorrect.  I got myself so nervous over this. I called and spoke to Marcy and she confirmed everything is under review and appears to be fine. I told her that she calmed me down immensely. Marcy provided excellent customer service to me. Thank you Marcy!!!,5
Roamright,"I needed to cancel my first order because I thought my husband was included, however he was not.I spoke with Caitlin and she was an amazing service representative. She redid this for both of us, and clearly explained every thing.She is certainly a gem working for your company.",5
Roamright,"Have used this company three times for travel coverage on family charter cruises in the Caribbean. No claims! The last time in 2020, we had paid for a charter in the BVI’s and shortly before departure, it became clear the Islands were likely to close their border (COVID) and there was significant chance we might be trapped there, difficult or unable to return. Subsequent events showed that would indeed have been the case. We cancelled, made no claim after paying almost 775$. The company offered a voucher credit for the insurance payment (for which they assumed no real risk) requiring use with 360 days. Ongoing covid and other factors made it impossible to recommit to a charter until this year. Both the airlines and Charter company offered credit and  have extended our ‘book before date’ to September “23. This seems unduly restrictive and I felt the staff person who refused my inquiry was at least mildly condescending.",1
Roamright,I purchased RoamRight for a group tour to Italy.  The tour was cancelled by Renaissance Group tours when the borders were closed due to COVID-19.   I was never reimbursed for the entire trip.  I paid for the entire trip. Lost $1900. because “ travel agents had expenses” too.         The tour operator died.  NEVER Roamright.,1
Roamright,"I guess in this instance you get what you pay for. I purchased travel insurance for a trip to Europe for a very fair price. However, we encountered a delay of trip due to a blizzard which caused us to miss multiple connections. Since the delay wasn't a full 24 hours, none of the new ticket expenses were covered. I guess I understand now that this is only for catastrophic coverage, and not for instances such as this.... But make sure you do your homework as we are out a bunch of money that we assumed would be covered as this is exactly what I thought travel insurance was for. If all I needed was catastrophic coverage, I probably had that for free with my credit cards.",2
Roamright,"Our luggage was delayed. Two days. I am going through the process to get a refund for expenses. About $150. Obviously Roam Right makes the process so much work to try and get customers to quit.   Not happy with this AT ALL!!  I have submitted receipts for the items we purchased (contact lens solution, toothpaste, deodorant, 3 shirts and a pair of pants - we had already worn the same clothe for over 48 hours), a copy of the report filed with the airline when the luggage was delayed and our boarding passes.  Now they want copies of our credit card statements.",3
Roamright,"Very disappointed , I purchased this travel insurance right before Covid -19. We had to cancel our trip due to the virus. When I called to see if I could put my policy on hold I was told that was not a problem and could use it for a future trip. But, when I called back to use it I was told it had lapsed and there was nothing they could do. I find this to be very frustrating and unfair especially since the country we were traveling too has only allowed foreigners back into the country within the last 6 months. I feel due to the pandemic and travel restrictions beyond our control this company should have made an effort to at least reach out to let me know there was an actual expiration date or made an option for a refund.",2
Roamright,"I didn’t care for Roam Right’s (RR) handling of the pandemic and deferred travel plans. I had a Cancel For Any Reason (CFAR) type policy pre-Covid that I was forced to switch out of when the tour got deferred and RR belatedly advised that CFAR policies were no longer offered and the travel dates could not merely be modified on the existing coverage I had purchased. This was contrary to what other companies were doing and what the tour group itself was doing with simply moving dates. RR valued its profit margins over its insured. I also found it’s “credit-carry over” policy for previously paid premiums to be cumbersome and difficult to maneuver since the world was not traveling as I faced looming expiration dates on the credit (for using money I already paid). Again, RR valued profit first.",2
Roamright,"I had to give it a 4-star because, thank goodness, we did not have to use the insurance.  It did allow us to breathe a sigh of relief that we could rely on Roam Right if any issues occurred during our overseas stay.",4
Roamright,"Last summer my husband and I were booked on a rather costly trip with Natural Habitat Adventures. Based on the recommendation of our travel advisor, Wendy, we purchased trip insurance with Arch. We are so grateful that we listened to Wendy. We contracted Covid prior to our departure on the NatHab tour. As they should, NatHab told us that we could not tour.The claim process with Arch was seamless. Because of the backlog, the payout timing was a bit slow; however, each time I called to follow, up, the customer service could not have been more helpful.",5
Roamright,"Filed a claim on May 17 th of this year 2022.  It is now Oct 15th, 2022 and I still have not gotten back a final decision on my claim.Contact has been minimal from RoamRight with most contact being initiated by me. I will leave it to the readers imagination what I feel about RoamRight.",1
Roamright,"This insurance is a joke. We have sent them the exact same documentation repeatedly, in full of all that they asked. They keep asking for the same documents and delaying paying our fully legitimate claim. Would not recommend to anyone, ever.",1
Roamright,"I recently had to cancel a trip because my daughter was going to have a baby. She previously had a still birth, so we were very anxious. I had planned the trip before she was pregnant, and canceled as soon as I found out when they were planning the cesarean section. I was appalled when you required a multiple page form to be completed by her doctor. In addition to the Credit card statements showing what I had paid for the trip, I also provided evidence showing my relationship with my daughter, of the previous still birth, and of the planned date of birth. I have heard nothing since. Not only am I out the $558 for the trip, I am out the $102 which I paid for my insurance.",1
Roamright,"We were delayed by 2 days.  We had to buy food at the airport and deoderant.  We already had toothbrushes.  They wouldn't cover these minimal expenses, because (7 days later) our bags arrived. Dont waste your money with this company",1
Roamright,I’ve used Arch RoamRight for years. Never had an issue even when I had to make a claim. One claim in five trips. RoamRight has always been cheaper than other companies.I would highly recommend this travel insurance company over and above all others.,5
Roamright,"While I didn't file a claim against my annual Roamright policy, 2 of my friends did. The experience was no positive. One friend was unable to get reimbursed for a covid delay where she needed medication and hotel nights (covid was covered at the time) while another was denied when he had a 14+ hour flight delay/cancellation - Roamright wanted paperwork he was unable to obtain from the airlines and deemed his receipts/boarding passes/flight notifications unacceptable. We believe that it is Roamright's policy to deny, deny, deny until you wear out and go away.",1
Roamright,My luggage didn't arrive. I filed a claim and sent all the documents. Now they want more. Some things I don't have or never received. I paid too much money for so little response and customer service. I would not recommend this company to anyone. I will tell the travel agency about my experience.,1
Roamright,Marce was knowledgeable and helpful. She sent documents to me as we spoke so I could ask any questions while the call continued. This was very helpful and unusual.,5
Roamright,It was time to renew my yearly travel insurance. The person I spoke to was efficient and able to take care of everything with one call. I have used Roam Right for many years for my travel insurance needs and also for Grandchildren's adventures. It has always been a pleasant experience.,5
Roamright,"Arranging for the policy was simple with clear understanding of the coverage.  I made no claim so I’m not in a position to assess that process.  My only request would be the ability to purchase coverage in a more “cafeteria” style since there are certain needs that are more important (to me) than others — although there are few, if any, options to do so.",5
Roamright,"My wife and I insured our trip to Italy and a 9-day cruise from June 2, 2023 thru June 15, 2023.  We purchased the Pro Plus plan thinking we'd have the best protection. During the last 4 days of our vacation, my wife and I both became very ill and were barely able to do anything other than sleep and eat occasionally.  Honestly, Covid did not cross our minds as others in our party had also gotten sick but had tested negative. We assumed it was food poising or some other bug.  We each missed 2 excursions on the 12th and 13th of June.  Barely feeling much better on the 15th, my wife and mustered up the energy for the 9 hour flight back the the US.  Not feeling any better, we drove straight from the airport to the ER where we were diagnosed with Covid-19.  Our claim was rejected becaues we did not get diagnosed DURING our trip while on board.We were sick as dogs.  The last thing we were thinking was obtaining an ""official onboard diagnosis"" to satisfy Arch RoamRight.  We provided the documentation they asked for...just not while on the ship. Nevermind my doctor's statement was dated June 15th and the fact that Covid takes days or a week even to manifest.  Common sense tells us that we would have had it while on the ship.  I will continue to purchase travel insurance but never again from RoamRight.",2
Roamright,"Travel insurance is one of those things you hope to never have to use.  We were fortunate and all went well and did not have to make a claim, but the peace of mind was well worth the cost.  Obtaining the insurance was easy and your operators were very helpfull.  Would recommend to any one that travels.",4
Roamright,Claim was denied for a DAMAGED suitcase $160.00 claim after paying over $1000.00 for insurance,1
Roamright,"Megan went ""above and beyond"" in helping me arrange insurance for my upcoming trip. They ALL made concessions and adjustments that they did not have to make. I just want to say ""thank you"".",5
Roamright,"Navigation & shopping for the right plan was easy. Clear explanations & pricing seemed fair. Fortunately, I didn't have to use their services so I cannot comment on their coverage & ease of use.",5
Roamright,"This last claim took way too long. Rep asked me for duplicate documents. Felt I was uploading over and over again. I reached out several times without responses. Thankfully, claim was accepted.",4
Roamright,"Darlene was very kind and had the correct information instantly to answer my question.  In fact, everyone there has been very thoughtful and knowledgeable throughout this process, which was a difficult emotional experience for me.  We appreciate the kindness extended to us by your entire team.",5
Roamright,Always have had a peace of mind with roam right in the past and did this trip as well! The process was pretty much seamless and the person that helped me was very helpful and knowledgeable. I would definitely use this company in future.,5
Roamright,We used Arch RoamRight for our trip to British Columbia. They were recommended by the tour company. We had no issues and our experience was satisfactory.,5
Roamright,Best policy we ever had.  We travel year round so the annual policy is not only cost effective but is also reasonably priced. Over the years we had to place a claim a few times.  The process was easy and we were extremely satisfied with Arch Roam Right service.  We’ve recommended them to several of our friends.,5
Roamright,"Not able to comment!Since we did not have to file any claims (thank God), we did not experience any interaction with Arch RoamRight company, therefore, unable to comment.",3
Roamright,"Feb 10, 2023-VERY SATISFIED!!The agent that I spoke with, was extremely knowledgeable and accessed our information immediately. Her explanation was simple with enough detail to understand the process. I was treated fairly and with respect. I will definitely use RoamRight insurance for our next adventure.Linda N",5
Roamright,"Helen was extremely helpful in answering my questions regarding the policy.  Also, in research I found that RoamRight has great reviews so now I can go on my trip with ease of mind.  Thank you.",5
Roamright,Never a problem with your company until this time in New Zealand when I. Got Covid.I tried to and I never could get through..  sort of disappointed!Bev Schlegel817-705-7452Text or call,4
Roamright,"Please be aware before purchasing insurance with Arch RoamRight. I purchased travel insurance in April for my trip to Ireland the end of May. While in Ireland, my husband and I both got COVID and we’re unable to fly home on June 7th because of the US’s restrictions at the time so we had to reschedule our flights for June 13th which was very costly. Also, had to book a new Airbnb for the additional days that we were required to stay. I filed my claims right away when we returned, June 14 to be exact. Over 3 months later, I am still waiting. On July 28, I received an email that it was in final review and would take 4-6 weeks, that time has come and gone. I call every week and I’m told the same thing they they are really busy. At this point, I feel that I am getting the run around. I’m very frustrated. I am out over $3,000 plus the cost of this insurance.",1
Roamright,thankfully have never had to use the benefits of traveler's insurance but recommend always purchasing a policy when traveling abroad even if it's a short trip.  roam right makes it easy to purchase and customize buying traveler's insurance. have purchased when traveling by airplane or even when taking a cruise,5
Roamright,"Thankfully we didn't need to use the insurance this time, but in the past we have. And Roam Right did help us cover the cost of a flight home from our vacation. That's why I keep using them and recommend them to anyone traveling!",5
Roamright,"Arch’s Roam Right is easy to purchase, and the cost is reasonable. The benefits are good. A traveler is protected.",5
Roamright,"I am not impressed with this company.  Our flight was canceled,  we had to cancel our hotel,  no refund.  I put in a claim for $399, which included canceled room, meals and transport to another hotel in the city we were stuck in and a meal.  I put everything in their form.  Then I get an email where I have to contact the airline again for more proof,  get written proof again from the hotel.  I won't be using this company again.",2
Roamright,I have health issues that could impact being able to go on my trip but with Roam Right there are no worries.  They will cover any costs and return my money if I can’t go.  I just feel they walk along side me on my trip to be there for any issues that might come up.  Coverage is important to me and I know it’s there with them.,5
Roamright,"Signing up for the insurance was easy and pleasant.  Thankfully, I didn't need to take advantage of their services.",4
Roamright,She was very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. She was able to answer my questions and provide the term and conditions section for review since it’s not easily readily available.,5
Roamright,I did not like the explanation why  what I believed to be a previous level of medical coverage was not or no longer avalable.,3
Roamright,"Broke my lag on a tripHad to pay everything but when I cam back ,reported with hospital receipts ,X-rays and all what was needed,4 month and nothingI will not recommend this company",1
Roamright,For the 1st time in my life I had to delay a trip for medical reasons. I incurred increased airfare and missed hotel stays.The claim process was very easy and I was able to recoup all losses.  The customer service was excellent.I highly recommend.,5
Roamright,"I had purchased insurance for a trip to Israel. Our trip was canceled at he end of last year, but you transferred our coverage to a trip to Alaska this year when we provided documentation. Thank you so much.",5
Roamright,It was simple to purchase a policy and understand what was covered. Fortunately I did not have to submit a claim so I cannot comment how easy it is receive reimbursement.,5
Roamright,"Our flight was delayed in Dallas due to a terrible storm and had to spend the night. Spent in the claim on August 24 and have heard nothing back from RoamRight.  What is the hold up for a simple straight foreward claim for $102.  Not asking for any food or other trip charges, just hotel charges.  this is the second time RoamRight has done this to us.",1
Roamright,"This was my first time purchasing travel insurance. This company Cham recommended from my travel agent. Fortunately, nothing went wrong that I had to use it. That said, I can’t really give a fair rating on the actual utilization of the policy. I have more upcoming international travel ahead, and I plan to use them again as the purchase was easy and the price was fair. I will say the deciding factor on this company versus a few others was they actually had someone answer the phone within a few minutes to answer my questions about policy coverage before I purchased it. The person I spoke with was very knowledgeable and very easy to work with. My thought process on the other companies was that if it takes 45 minutes for someone to answer the phone to sell you a policy, how long would it take if you actually had to use the policy!",5
Roamright,The trip RoamRight insured was supposed to happen in 2020.  The policy was purchased in early 2019.  The trip never happened until fall of 2022.  The company rolled over the first time with no change in fee.  Second time it rolled over there was a small fee.  This company was certainly flexible during the pandemic.,5
Roamright,Your representative did an excellent job of listening to our needs & suggesting the very best policies for our needs.  She was both pleasant & quite professional to deal with!!!,5
Roamright,"Although we did not have to use the insurance, Roamright was very amenable when we had to postpone our trip several times due to Covid.  Would definitely use them again.",5
Roamright,"Helen was very helpful and informative, we have nine people going on our trip, and she broke it down into understandable portions",5
Roamright,I wasn’t allowed to purchase insurance because it was too close to the time of the trip. Other travel insurance companies allowed me to do so.,2
Roamright,"Couldn't buy a policy less than 21 days before desired start date, so found a competitor who would write the policy.",1
Roamright,We had the best plan and fortunately had no use for our insurance. It was comforting to know we had the policy and would buy it again for another trip.,5
Roamright,I renewed my travel policy (annual coverage expiring in July 2022) and was told I would receive and updated email with the new 2023 expiration date. I did not received the email as promised.,3
Roamright,"This is the second trip we have insured with your company, and the price and coverage we received were exceptional.We recommend to our fellow travelers!",5
Roamright,"Travelled to Italy and got Covid. Unable to flight back to the US. I changed flights, and booked to a different hotel for additional days because the current place was fully booked.The company covered ALL ADDITIONAL EXPENSES:-Airline change fees-Hotels (additional days) Example: If your checkout day is the 14th, they start counting the next day (15th)-Food-Ground transportationIssues:-They took 3 months to approve my claim (Probably they were doing deep research).-They don't answer emails. (I emailed every 3 weeks).-They answer the phone quickly so you can submit your inquiry but don't expect a call back from them. However, you will receive an email if they need more information.-On the Insurance booklet says the following information: ""All benefits payable under the Policy will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of such Loss. All claims shall be paid within 20 days following receipt by the Company of due proof of Loss. Failure to pay withinsuch period shall entitle You to interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of the payment agreement.""However, my approved claim (EOB) do not included any ""interest"" amount.Do I will recommend this insurance to a friend? Probably. If you don't need the refund ASAP is a good insurance. Otherwise, compare other insurances.Tip: Always check the maximum amount the insurance will pay before buying. Not all cheap insurances include benefits that you will need (in case that something happens).Save all receipts (specially those after checkout).-Hector",3
Roamright,"Fortunately we did not have and problems. We did not have to use your services. They were very expensive but provided us peace of mind!Thank you,Linda Knapp",5
Roamright,"Where do I begin with this horrible company as well as awful customer service?!?! We had planned a trip in June 2022, to Belize. Bought, what we thought, was good travel insurance. On the day of our vacation (6 hours before our flight), Delta airlines, canceled our trip TWICE. Resulting in us NOT able to make it to our destination. Sadden, we (4 of us) came back home. I immediately contacted the insurance company and they told me to file a claim. So I did…6 long months later, we were told our claim was denied, because “they do not cover flight cancellations”! We have waited so long on this horrible insurance company that now we are NOT able to even get our money back through our credit card company. So now we are out of a vacation and the money….$4000 for the resort in Belize is all we were asking for. If I could give Arch RoamRight zero stars I would. My advice to anyone out there looking for a good travel insurance…DO NOT PURCHASE ARCH ROAMRIGHT!! They will take your money, string you along and be very rude to you in the process.",1
Roamright,"We just tried to find the cheapest policy that met the possibilities that might befall us. Everything went fine and we had no claims, so I have no idea how the response might have been.",3
Roamright,"My experience was amazing.  Corey, was kind, professional and informative.  I enjoy my experience every time I call to use this service.",5
Roamright,It was very easy to purchase this insurance. I just wish that I had been able to get the waiver for all circumstances so that I would be completely protected.,4
Roamright,"RoamRight gave me confidence during my extended trip. Although I never needed services, it was good to know help was just a phone call away, if needed.",5
Roamright,Excellent !!!!! Pleasant customer service. No pressure to buy. If you travel a lot the yearly subscription  of ArchRoamRight is perfect. Thks again,5
Roamright,"Easy to get policy.  Have used several times in the past to order policy, but luckily never had to use it.  Therefore can offer no feedback on how easy benefits can be used",5
Roamright,"We just renewed our yearly travel insurance plan.  It was very easy and done with a quick phone call.  The rep was knowledgeable and easy to understand.  We have had RoamRight for about 5 years.  The first year, our trip to Hawaii for a cruise was halted when my husband had a stroke.  We were able to easily get all the money back!  It is so comforting to have the yearly policy and not need to buy insurance for each flight or cruise.  I love that we have medical coverage when 100 miles from home!",5
Roamright,Great Customer Service and a great product. We have been using Roam Right for over 10 years on all of our international travel. The claim process is simple and our claims were paid with in days. It’s a great comfort to know that Roam Right has you covered!,5
Roamright,"I came across the rating page for Arch RoamRight by accident when thinking of traveling again and i just wanted to warn people of RoamRight Insurance. 8/2022 I left a one star review and explained: we paid for a trip with full insurance. First payment 11/2019. Last payment 2/2020.  Our trip was canceled because borders were closed after our final payment and the trip never took place.  I am still owed the balance of $1,890.  9/2022 I was contacted by RoadRight and asked to submit information to them and they would review it.  Just got their response.""According to the information submitted, you filed a claim for your 2020/2021 postponed trip on 10/22/2022. The tripnever took place as it was cancelled due to the pandemic.Since the claim was filed out of the timeline allowed to file the claim, we are unable to honor your claim. Additionally,the reason for your claim is an excluded reason; therefore no benefits are payable.""No one in the general public was using the words COVID-19 or Pandemic, in November 2019. It was not an excluded reason in 2019/2020.  Since when is a trip cancelled by the travel agent and not taking place a reason for not refunding ALL monies paid. ALL MONIES. We never received plane tickets, hotel confirmations. The company knew the claim/trip was 2020.  Yet they still asked me to file a claim in 2022.  Why? so they could dig it in just a little bit more, they don't pay their claims.  Let that sink in.",1
Roamright,"The phone was answered promptly.My questions were answered with expert knowledge, and a policy was produced that suited our needs and that was also within our budget!",5
Roamright,No review text found,5
Roamright,We have used Arch Roam Right for two trips.  Thankfully we have not had to use the benefits of the policy but the on-line purchase was very easy.  It was necessary to change the dates of our most recent policy and we were able to do this with one phone call.,5
Roamright,Never get RoamRight insurance for travel. All they do is ask for more forms to be completed over and over. It has been 3 months since I filed a claim and they never cough up any cash for any reason. Completely useless. A waste of your money. Avoid them like the plague.,1
Roamright,"You received my claims for months now.  I received #1 letter, received claim. #2 letter, will hear in 30 days. #3 letter will hear in another 30 days .  What kind of games are you playing.  Pay the claims",1
Roamright,Complete failure!My flight was late and despite two phone calls and an email they where unable to amend the booking and I was left with no car when I arrived.,1
Roamright,"Thank god I didn’t have to use, however it offered a piece of mind knowing I had the protection I might need when being so far away in the Dominican Republic.",5
Roamright,Megan was fantastic !!!!!   She listened intently to what I had to say/ask and made me feel like my concerns really mattered to her and she provided me with the answers I needed.,5
Roamright,"Easy to purchase, even easier this year because you kept all my information. Glad I did not use your insurance but glad I had it.",5
Roamright,could not register policy as could not locate access code on any documents. Did not receive ID cards. waited in chat room but no one came on in the time I had.,1
Roamright,I work in the travel industry and get a special policy through Arch which I have been buying for years. In all that time and all those many trips we have had one claim which was very promptly and efficiently dealt with. I'm very glad to have Arch at my back wherever I am in the world.,5
Roamright,"Fortunately, we didn’t need to use our insurance on this trip but we did on another trip and we received a prompt refund with no hassles.",5
Roamright,"We purchased a policy for a ski trip to Italy. Our skis did not make it and the airport representative suggested we wait 3 hours for the next flight to arrive as she suspected our skis would be on it and if we didn't stay it would be 2-3 days before they delivered them. I called the 24 hr hotline as I was concerned I would not be reimbursed for the time delay fee we would have to pay the car service we had pre-arranged. I was assured I had trip delay and thus would be compensated. We were subsequently denied the claim as trip delay does not cover this expense. I responded with the information I was given on the call and the call date and time and told them to listen to the recording. They said they listened to the call and ""No assurances were provided"". I asked them to send me the call as I disagreed. After 4 emails to them over several weeks they said they would get me the call. Several more weeks went by and I had to email them again. This time they responded that they could not give me the call or the transcript I had requested as it was not their property to give away, and admitted they had not listened to the call, but HAD read the transcript (I doubt it). I again asked for the call or the transcript as it should be of no concern since I AM THE ONE RECORDED and I am giving my consent...Nothing...My feeling is that this company is basically a scam - I thought for once I would get a return of my insurance investment, but of course, they don't want to give any $ back. DON'T BUY THEIR INSURANCE!!!",1
Roamright,This is one of the worst insurance companies in the travel business. I purchase this policy in April 2022.I traveled to Spain on 4/22/2022 to 05/15/2022.Our flight got cancelled from Madrid to Porto and TAP airline didn't notified me. I had to book with Iberia and Ryanair on May 10 to May 13 my girlfriend wanted to see Porto. She got sick in Madrid on May 5 - May 10 and we decided to go home. She had diarrhea. We file a claim shortly after that. We had to get a special form so that the doctor could fill it out.It is now August 31 2022 and no decision has been made. Never do business with this company. The rates are too good to be true. All the proof was send in to the company. On Sept 15 I got a 2 check for 498.37.,1
Roamright,"I felt comfortable. as a senior citizen, knowing I had a medical plan to cover me on a recent cruise.",5
Roamright,Was forced to cancel a trip — over 6 months in advance. Arch RoamRight rep worked with us to apply funds for an alternative.,5
Roamright,Roam Right denied our claim because they said Amtrak preemptively canceled our train because of a pending railroad strike. Amtrak was told by the railroad company they could not use the railroad tracks. Amtrak does not own the tracks so when they were informed that there was a pending strike and they could not use the tracks they canceled trains. Arch Roam Right wasn’t involved in the process and made their own determination. If Amtrak could have ran our trip wouldn’t have been cancelled. If Amtrak hadn’t been told by the railroad company they could not use the tracks our trip wouldn’t have been canceled. Arch Roam Right just doesn’t want to pay the claim. Its amazing how they know more about what happened then Amtrak.So we also took out a policy on a trip scheduled for 3/2023. After the experience with the above claim we cancelled the claim for the March 2023 trip. Arch Roam Right has refused to refund our money for that policy as well. This company is not in the business of helping people they are only in it to take your money and give you a false sense of security. They refuse to pay valid claims and refuse to refund money for claims not going to be used. If this isn’t fraud what is?,1
Roamright,Had no need to make a claim but peace of mind while traveling was great. Wish it were 15% less expensive.,4
Roamright,Easy to work with and the comfort of knowing we were well covered in case anything occurred prior to trip departure or during the trip itself just left us relax and enjoy the experience so much more.,5
Roamright,Could not get a refund because my husband could not go due to health issues and the price went up for me.,3
Roamright,I have been purchasing Arch RoamRight primary rental car insurance for years.  I found it to be superior and a better value than any rental car waiver available from rental car companies.I will continue to purchase Arch RoamRight rental car insurance and recommend that you consider it instead of relying upon a credit card secondary insurance or a waiver that a rental car company offers.,5
Roamright,"I am glad I didn't have to use it, but glad I had it just in case. If you are going to travel, get travel insurance. RoamRight always seems to have a good price for travel insurance.",5
Roamright,"Helen was very personable.  Quick, knowledgeable.  Unfortnately my phone cut off and I wasn't able to tell her..",5
Roamright,We cancelled a river cruise and had a credit for travel insurance….we used our credit for three trips and found the staff we worked with to be very helpful.  We would use this company again.,5
Roamright,"UPDATE: Yes, definitely a scam! They just denied my claim of $242 for my delayed luggage of 3 weeks citing some crazy fineprint loophole that gets them out of paying. They also try to make me sound like a liar by saying: ""You said the luggage was lost but you never provided proof of that"". After weeks of no update on my luggage, the airline said they think it's lost. At that point I sent an email to this con of a company saying, my baggage might be lost, how do I update the claim? They never replied or acknowledged this. They never asked me to provide proof, so I assumed they never even got it or got around to seeing it. I have documentation between myself and the airline back and forth for weeks!!! Absolutely disgusting, vile people run this company. If you know how insurance companies work, the one assigned to your claim gets a commission of the money that they DONT pay you, the customer. And it shows.Dont waste your money on these con artists. They'll never pay you anyway.I'm not sure but I think this company might be a scam. I travelled a month and a half ago and got the insurance which I usually get and never needed until now. My luggage was misplaced by the airline for over 3 weeks, so I had to buy some stuff to replace until/if it was found. The maximum is $400 and we only needed $250. I filed the claim a month and a half ago and when I checked in multiple times, I get vague answers and the chat rep was extremely rude telling me that ""it's only been a few weeks"". Stop blaming all your issues on Covid, just get your act together and deliver on your promises. I'll happily edit my review if I ever get my money back. Otherwise, be warned!!",1
Roamright,The representative that assisted was so patient with all my questions. Thank you so much for your help!!!,5
Roamright,The website is easy to use and the product is reasonably priced. Luckily we didn't need to file a claim so I can't rate that.,5
Roamright,This company never lets me downThey always deliver my insurance as I travel to South America,5
Roamright,Hi alls well. Except on air linus my brand new suit case got ripped. These are quality bags and to be thrown quite hard to damaged. I filed claim with air line but no answer yet. Filed 18 july when I returned early.,5
Roamright,"My agent, Carla was very helpful.  She gave a broad overview of the coverage",4
Roamright,"When requesting to change the dates for travel insurance coverage due to a cyclone that caused a cancellation of a airline flight, a request was made to change the coverage dates, Arch RoamRight ask for verification of the cancelled flight for the coverage dates and a document was provided showing the flight cancellation. Roamright did not modify the coverage dates and I had coverage only for the original coverage dates.  My travel dates was was moved back seven days from the original coverage dates because of the airline cancellation so I had no coverage for the last seven days of my vacation. I will be looking to use another travel insurance company for future travel",1

Roamright,"My wife and bought a policy to travel to Jordan.  Our luggage was damaged in transit.  There was no United airline agent in Amman to file a claim with so we tried to file electronically, that site did not work. We called the airline when we returned to the US and they told us to file with Lufthansa airlines.  I contacted Lufthansa and they referred the claim to the first airline and said they would contact us, they never did.  SO, we filed a claim with ARCH RoamRight for $91 for a replacement bag. Arch RoamRight dragged the claim out, asked for more information 3 times then denied our claim (for $225, not what we asked for).  SO, they did not pay attention to what we requested, wasted my time and were happy to take my money, but didn't pay a reasonable claim.  We have two more trips scheduled this year, based on this experience we will NOT be using this Company again.  Looks penny wise and pound foolish to me for them to have denied this claim.The reply from Arch Roam Right sounds good but doesn't explain why they denied a claim for $225 when I was only asking for $91.  Seems their complete documentation and thorough review might have missed some minor (?) points when looking for a way to deny the claim.",2
Roamright,"We were on a 2 week international trip that was extended for a week longer than expected. I called RoamRight to see if we could extend the coverage and the agent I spoke with was very helpful. Since it was under the one month time period, our trip was covered at no extra charge. It was relieving to know that we had the coverage.",5
Roamright,"It's about getting a quick resolution... This was my first time using Roam Right and I have been waiting on a refund regarding a claim I made over 2 months ago. I have not had great answers as to the results and am still awaiting any final decision. I have been told by the customer service, on more than one occasion, that my claim is in its final stage and someone would email me within 2 weeks with an answer but...I'm still waiting.",2
Roamright,"We have used this company for the last ten trips. When we had to cancel a trip because of COVID, the company promptly paid the claim and, above and beyond, credited the policy cost to be used later that year.",5
Roamright,RoamRight proved to be a good carrier.  Only had one claim for non refundable deposit because of new cardio problem. Filed papers; promptly paid.,5
Roamright,Efficient and easy to understand coverages.,5
Roamright,This is a review regarding the purchase of Arch Roam Right Insurance with Gate 1 travel trips.  The dates for coverage need to be specific to the policy...confusing and expensive insurance.  Also my claim was denied and when I appealed it took over a month of constant emails to receive any type of reply.  Not user friendly,1
Roamright,"Great, timely service over the phone.  Will use again!",5
Roamright,No review text found,5
Roamright,On the last day of my trip two flights wee cancelled and rebooked after the lat day of my coverage. RoamRight responded immediately to my e-mail inquiry assuring me that they would cover delay expenses despite those expenses occurring after the date of coverage.  I made a phone call to customer service while filling out the claim form and received prompt and courteous help. I will definitely use Arch RoamRight in the future.,5

Roamright,"So-so.  Good to have, luckily didn't need.Was sold via an Israel trip organizer.  Trip was originally scheduled for December, postponed to March.  When the dates were finally set, I went back to RoamRight web site to book the travel insurance again, was told that I couldn't because the trip was too close.  HOWEVER, an insurance aggregator was happy to sell RoamRight trip insurance, so that's clearly an inconsistency.  When I called, I was able to book insurance, less the trip cancellation part, and that was just fine with me.",3
Roamright,"We purchased this insurance as required by the TCI (Turks and Caicos) travel requirements, even though my BCBS policy seemed to cover all the stipulations.  It was accepted quickly and we had no problem receiving our travel approvals from the TCI government.",5
Roamright,"What a ridiculous service. I just waste my money but no return of benefit whatsoever. I bought the travel insurance on March 12, 2020 for Singapore trip but the airlines canceled the trip due to Covid. My hotel and airfare were refunded but Arch RoamRight denied the refund. I want my money back!!!!",1
Roamright,"Marcy gave me information that I did not want to hear.  Regardless, she was nice, sensitive and super helpful.  You're lucky to have her.  Also, I have to say that I was really pleased not to have to wait for an unreasonable time.  The information about wait time plus call back option is terrific.",5
Roamright,"This was the first time I've purchased travel insurance and my customer service rep, Megan, was fantastic.  She asked questions to make sure she understood what I needed and then walked me through the process of getting the right insurance set-up for me.  I also thought the price was reasonable and fair.",5
Roamright,This is a scam !  My husband and I purchase insurance for $650 were told we could cancel for any reason of illness. Our trip was scheduled for January 17 on January 4 we both tested positive for Covid because we were traveling to Aruba out of the country both airline and hotel required us to have a Covid test three days before travel obviously three days before travel it would’ve been positive so we canceled the trip this insurance is now claiming because my quarantine was over on January 14 three days before the trip they will not reimburse me the $5500 that I laid out for the hotel. On what planet do these people live on that they assume three days after quarantine we both will not be testing positive for Covid. I am disgusted I am not letting this go and I will fight this to the end beware of this !!!,1
Roamright,I have had an easy time with the help of Roamright getting the right policy and renewing it.The one time I needed help--the Icelandic Volcanic ash--the help was immediate.,5
Roamright,"Top Notch.  Agent sparkled--told her I have hearing impairment--she said I'll speak a little louder and slower, and she did! which is a great help.  Her service was intelligent, quick, efficient, she understood my request instantly and sent me the quote.  Almost makes me glad to buy insurance.Eric",5
Roamright,RoamRight has the perfect plans for numerous travel situations.  The website is easy to navigate.  The Covid conditions are clearly explained.,5
Roamright,Always good prices and attentive customer service.,5
Roamright,Fantastic customer service.   I called to adjust a policy I bought for my daughter traveling to the Caribbean.  The phone was answered quickly and the person I spoke to was friendly and efficient.  He resolved my issue quickly and had a new policy sent within minutes.  In the current environment I felt much better knowing RoamRight was there for my daughter if something went wrong.,5
Roamright,"Did not have to use policy. Straightforward, easy to apply for policy.",5
Roamright,Even though I had your insurance I still had to pay out of pocket for testing,2
Roamright,Love RoamRight very great service and great rates  !,5
Roamright,We purchased trip ins several times and our recent experience with illness caused us to have to cancel a family trip and the trip insurance paid our claim.  We will definitely but trip insurance again and thank you for paying our claim.,5
Roamright,Very easy to use. Perfect for non hassle insurance with a great price.,5
Roamright,"When I extremely needed a travel insurance this company literally rescued me. I had plenty of issues conerning my journey, but this one was the major one. I believed that I could handle with it by my own, however i was mistaken. I chose this company becaue it seemed to me pretty reliable. I talked to managers and explained in details the whole situation. They promised me to help in short times, and actually they did it. I took out a travel insurance and nowadays I'm on my trip without any worries and I don't bother about something that might happen.",5
Roamright,I did not have to use my coverage but as usual RoamRight had me covered.,5
Roamright,"Bought the insurance….my wife’s orthopedic surgeon told her NOT to go on vacation…..I have to submit a ton of paperwork and still haven’t heard anything.  vacation was Dec 10, 2021.  Should have been real simple",3
Roamright,Having this backup plan behind the scenes of our trip gave us peace of mind. Thankfully we didnt need to use the coverage.,5
Roamright,"Im in the process of making a complaint with the Federal Trades Commission. This company sold us travel insurance with trip interruption. Well our paris trip has been cancelled due to the border closing from UK , not a big deal right??!! Our $450 tickets will be taken care of because we have travel insurance .NOPE, called them and border closing is not an ""unforeseen"" reason and will not be covered! I said well now we're stuck in London with no accommodations for 5 nights .. but NOPE, nothing they will do for that!.  They offered me my money back on the policy. But buyers need to know, not only will they not cover, they will make you jump threw hoops.  When bad things happen ,knowing you have an insurance agent to call and help gives you such peace of mind. Not here, total nightmare.  My CC company instructed me to make reports. There are so many trying screw people with covid fears. This company is the worst!",1
Roamright,Easy & fast process at purchase AND in case of reimbursement. Other insurance companies make you fill tons of paperwork and take months to reimburse you. Arch RoamRight is now my 1st choice!,5
Roamright,Easy to obtain. Simple application.  We did not have to use travel insurance however I cannot comment on its use.,5
Roamright,"This company was very responsive to our claim and the ""check was in the mail"" within days.Excellent job.Highly recommend and have already selected them for our next trip.",5
Roamright,I don't do reviews without compensation reflecting the value of my opinion which you believe is worth nothing. So thats what you got,2
Roamright,The Arch RoamRight agent handled my request as indicated by me. The coverage was what I needed for my upcoming trips.,5
Roamright,"Getting all your rules figured out made deciding on the coverage we needed to buy a little dicey at the beginning.  Then, however, since you didn't get a call from us during the trip we can't evaluate just how kind, considerate and generous you are when it comes to handling a claim.  If COVID hadn't been around, once again we wouldn't have even considered buying insurance and trusted our basis good health to prevail, as it did.  Basically a waste of $400 plus that would have covered the tips on out transatlantic back to Florida.",4

Roamright,"The service was great. However, after over 2 weeks since then I have not gotten email or call or any follow up from Roam Right about purchasing a travel insurance with the voucher. I could have given 5 stars if I were sure if the phone service really worked.",4

Roamright,"Your representative, Charlotte (I believe) was amazing. She took time to answer our questions and totally explain policyShe totally deserves kudos for her wonderful representation of your company.Thank you and please compliment our rep.",5
Roamright,Very comfortable on vacation knowing your insurance was with us!,5
Roamright,"Brutal experience trying to get a partial refund for the trip cancelation canceled for health reasons.They take a very long time to process every piece of information. That said, they were lightning quick to deny the claim, with a lengthy ""canned"" explanation referencing their terms and conditions.Lawyer suggested to waste no time and go to Small Claims Court.Regardless, I would recommend to stay as far away from them, as you can - there are many really honest large insurers out there.UPDATE. For all of you blissful hopefuls who paid for this garbage coverage but never filed claims, check out TrustPilot for Arch Insurance, the ""proud owner"" of RoamRight to help you research before buying.UPDATE II. Lawyer suggested to give it just one more try, so I will email them and will post the outcome.UPDATE 2. I contacted you by email - no response whatsoever after 3 weeks. Useless...UPDATE 3. No reply whatsoever, as of now, April 8, 2022. Completely ignoring my communication.UPDATE 4. If you take a look at their previous response, it is a ""canned"" email. I did provide my contact information back in November, but to no avail whatsoever.UPDATE 5. I contacted the company in a separate email back in April 2022, but they completely disregarded it - no follow up whatsoever. No surprise to me though. There are great companies out there, trustworthy, competitively priced, great customer service.Why would anyone want to deal with Roam-So-Called-Right?",1
Roamright,Claim still has not been processed.  It was submitted on October 8 and it is now October 20.  Claims department should be working overtime if there is a backlog.,1
Roamright,We have used Roam Right for several years and about six trips. They are priced right and offer the options we need.We submitted one claim over the years and it was handled quickly.,5
Roamright,"My experience with RoamRight was excellent.During this time of a pandemic,life has  changed dramatically..My trip abroad was cancelled and rescheduled several times.RoamRight changed my policy without question. The agents I spoke with we’re always pleasant and professional.Where do you get customer service like that ? I’ll always use and recommend RoamRight..",5
Roamright,Was happy that it could be paid by pay pal and paid it in payments than all up front. Web site easy to use and had different plans to choose from plus add-on that could be customized.,5
Roamright,Every time I have called the representatives are friendly and fast and knowledgeable.  The wait times to get a rep were short,5
Roamright,This is my review with more than 10 characters,5
Roamright,Best amazing awesome fabulous,5
Roamright,"I do not buy travel insurance because of the excessive premium.  I bought medical travel insurance for my last trip due to the covid problems, but did not feel comfortable with it.  Wasn't assured that coverage would be there if I had a covid situation.  Policy explanation was not clear about its coverage.",3
Roamright,I think I was over overcharged. They charged me from the date I paid in may through the end of my trip in august.  I thought it would just be for the 5 day trip,3
Roamright,We purchased insurance to protect a vacation that was canceled because of the pandemic. We tried to reschedule the vacation twice and both times we had to cancel because of the pandemic. We had both requested a refund and or a credit with the company which we were told they do not do. We had no other trip planned to transfer the insurance for. When trying to reach the company the hold time is way too long. So basically we lost our money.,1
Roamright,"Worst customer service ever! Read from scripts only and didn't answer any of my purchasing questions or treat me like an individual. Happened both by email and live chat. Outrageous!P.S. Their response is non-responsive to my issue. My call wasn't about cancelling my policy, it was about trying to understand the difference in policies and they were useless and about engaging me and my situation as an individual rather just reading scripts.  Beyond useless actually.",1

Roamright,"I like your coverage, but luckily we did not need anything! Keep it up.",5
Roamright,well-----------------  my  luggage arrived  late when i got back home-- but thats not  covered---  other than  that-- no complaints,5
Roamright,"I am not entirely sure why....I purchased the travel insurance thinking that there would be some protection against the crazy nature of travel now.  I had considerable issues coming back from the BVIs as a result of a delayed flight out of Tortola.  Apparently trip delay only applies when you are traveling to your destination and not when you are returning.  Fortunately I was able to get the airlines to address things finally.  Very little communication from Arch other than ""NO.""  Save your powder next time and hold it for the delay instead of Arch.  Incidentally, I am in the travel business and encourage our guests to use the insurance.  May have to rethink that having been on the other side of it now.  Poor performance.",1

Roamright,"The RoamRight personnel were very helpful when we purchased our travel insurance for our two-week vacation. Unfortunately, we had to cut our vacation short because our son needed to be hospitalized. The RoamRight claim process was very fair and prompt. We would purchase this insurance again.",5
Roamright,"The pandemic caused governments to close down countries and activities.  So this effectively cancelled all travel, vacations etc and the operator could not put on the camp trip.  But Arch Insurance denies our claim because we didn't send a letter to the operator to tell them to ""cancel"".  If we don't send notice then its not covered.... there was no trip for us to cancel as the government and operator already cancelled it!  What a sleazy operation.",1
Roamright,"We purchased travel insurance with Arch RoamRight in 2020 for a 2 week trip to 3 African countries, So. Africa, Zimbabwe, and Botswana. Our premium was $1,898.00. Two of the flights between countries were to be  on South Africa Air. Everything was paid for and one month before our departure, So. Africa Air defaulted (bankrupt) and would not refund our $1500 in flights. We had to pay for different flights, which cost more. Our claim was denied by RoamRight because So. Africa Air said we could have a travel credit. But there is no sign the Airline will ever fly again. Also, we would have to return to Africa to use it. RoamRight did the wrong thing. They are greedy and we will never use them again.",1
Roamright,Very bad experience with roam right insurance.  Bought insurance for 11 people with cancellation for any reason.  Three of our family members didn't make the flight after getting to the airport 2 1/2 hours before take off.  Line was horribly long.  We were all together and 3 of our family members were right behind us but obviously not fast enough.  They shut the doors and only 8 of us made it on.  Told everyone not to worry because we had insurance and could cancel for any reason.  We lost the airline tickets from Southwest and bought Frontier tickets but insurance decided to not help us out since it wasn't written in the contract that way.  What a waste of money to buy insurance.,1
Roamright,Highly recommend and happy to see the insurance company at work!,5
Roamright,"I had a great experience with them, they really helped me with problems that I encountered while traveling.",5
Roamright,Everyone was friendly and very helpful as I navigated through this process.,5
Roamright,"We requested and were sold a Covid coverage policy for Turks &Caicos for $285 for two people and were  not sent an accompanying letter which said we had covid 19 coverage.  We were refused entrance to Turks and Caicos the morning before we were to leave due to the type of insurance we had been sold .  We were unable to reach anyone in the Arch RoamRight office, but finally got the emergency evacuation person. She found someone on Saturday afternoon that could send us the correct form that finally allowed us to get clearance to the island.  It was a very unnecessarily stressful situation caused by Arch documentation of Covid coverage that was not provided initially.  I called for a partial refund and the agent refused.   Please review and perhaps you can realize what a mistake you made at the customers expense.  Thank you.  Looking forward to hearing from you.Harry and Carolyn Easom",1
Roamright,Arch RoamRight provided a great travel insurance service that was affordable and easy to sign up for. We ended up needing to make a claim due to a trip cancellation for medical reasons and the claim settlement process was smooth and quick. We will use the service again.,5
Roamright,Very pleasant and efficient reinstatement of policy for previously cancelled travel: thanks!,5
Roamright,"When I was booking the insurance customer service was very supportive. That has drastically changed now that I have filed a claim.  Since initially submitting my claim for cancelled travel eight weeks ago I have been repeatedly asked for more documentation. All of which I supplied promptly and all of which could have been included with my original claim, had it been requested at that time. It appears that the claim process is designed to procrastinate payment.  Other than the automated email generated to provide the most limited amount of information regarding the status my claim, my email is not responded to, nor are my phone calls.Please pay my claim.Thank you",2
Roamright,"This is the slowest, most useless service. Horrible customer service, unclear UX/UI/Content Design that tells you absolutely nothing about the status of your claim.",1
Roamright,I have not had a claim so I cannot tell you how good the service will be in this area.  As far as issuing the contract I had no problems except for the pandemic which of course made the policy useless.  We did not travel anywhere for the past year and will not travel anywhere this year. So we are not buying an annual contract again at this time.  Once it is safe to travel internationally I will be buying another contract.,5
Roamright,Happy with turnaround time and the outcome,5
Roamright,"I want confidence when I travel.  I purchased this insurance with trust and it gave me confidence.  When my trip had to be cancelled for a work reason based on new CDC guidelines for travel outside the country my claim was denied because I was cancelling for ""fear"" of Covid.  Nobody would even listen that it was not my choice and it was definitely not fear.  Shame on roam right for twisting fine print and taking advantage of customers in a time like we are living in with so much uncertainty.",1
Roamright,"RoamRight does everything right up until you actually have to file a claim. At that moment, they are incredibly slow, nonresponsive and full of ""I need more information"". RoamRight is doing everything possible to not have to process the Claim. They refuse to have a conversation on the phone and instead default to email and closing our your Claim without an explanation. Look elsewhere. This service deserves legal attention.",1
Roamright,"I bought a year long policy on January 26, 2020.  RoamRight accepted my payment and issued the policy. Over a week later, RoamRight announced that they would not honor the policy for Covid related claims retroactively to January 20th. I plan to Roam again and if you guess it will be without this company you will be Right. Total waste of money.",1
Roamright,"Unfortunately, due to the pandemic and all the border closures that ensued, I was not able to utilise the insurance that I purchased.  I had planned trips to the UK, New York, Portugal, & South Africa and all the trips were cancelled due to quarantine regulations as well as airline stoppages.  I wish the policy was able to be extended to 2021 when I hope to take the same trips.  The premium of $574 is a great deal to lose.  If this is possible, I would appreciate being contacted by the company.  I have tried to contact their customer service but have been unable to reach anyone.After leaving this review I was contacted by their customer service to discuss the situation.  Roam Right has agreed to refund my premium from when I was notified that my first trip was cancelled.  I am very satisfied with this result and would use the company again when we can start traveling again.",2
Roamright,I was very pleased with this coverage for ease of applying and changing dates for my trip. After comparing with a policy I carried before I felt it was very affordable. Thank you keep up the good work !,5

Roamright,I keep sending proofs of my claim and they don't seem to pay much attention as they ask me for the same things again and again...still no refund made after claiming almost 2 months ago for a simple doctor's visit with antibiotics!,3
Roamright,"After a number of years, 2020 will be last year we purchase travel insurance from Arch Roam Right for the two of us.As in purchasing any insurance, one wants to know if insurance companies will  readily assist their customers when a legitimate claim (s) is filed according to the policy or be adversarial toward claimants in order to place profit ahead of the good of their customers. This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.   In the end, we really want to feel secure knowing any insurance company will have our back according to the purchased policy or service. I don't have that with this Roam Right Insurance.  I am glad to find this out before something really happened abroad!!!",1
Roamright,Sense of travel security is worth the cost.Thank You,5
Roamright,"Through corona virus and a pandemic, no help with cancellations and refunds was provided. All travel ceased and the insurance just lapsed and was never used or refunded.",2
Roamright,"Claim communication wasn't the best , When i was able to talk to an employee they was very informative and explained clearly what I would need to submit with my claim to prevent delays  the process was pretty much straight forward and convenient to submit everything from home.  But I will definitely use them again in the future for travel.",5
Roamright,Called back from last year as our trip was cancelled.  Arch let us move our coverage up to this year.  It was an easy transition and we were treated very kindly.  Even got a better price and a refund check.  Our agent was very knowledgeable and very professional.  Thanks,5
Roamright,Was a quick and simple process. Someone always picked up the phone when I called and were helpful.,4
Roamright,It was easy and Arch RoamRight was so quick with the payment!!! I will definitely use them again in the future!,5
Roamright,Was a quick and simple process. Someone always picked up the phone when I called and were helpful.,5
Roamright,"Arch RoamRight was very prompt at processing my claim. The steps to submit my documentation were straightforward on the website portal, and the customer service representative was in regular contact while my claim was under review. I've insured trips before with Arch RoamRight and will use them again in the future.",5
Roamright,"A small uncomplicated claim took 3 months to the refund and an array of unnecessary time wasting emails e.g. the currency in Grenada is $EC/USD and Roam Right asked if I paid in Barbadian dollars (which is not legal tender in Grenada), 20 days Quick Pay was lost waiting for Roam Right to answer, then I received an email I can access Quick Pay immediately followed by another email that the time had expired, Roam Right used my banks zip code as my zip code (!), on average 2/3 weeks for a reply from Roam Right plus other. Totally unprofessional.",1
Roamright,"I will always choose RoamRight. They provided outstanding, above-and-beyond customer service and benefits when we really needed it. This is a company with integrity (not something I would say about many insurance companies).",5
Roamright,"A very friendly and helpful woman sent me the information I wanted, right away.",5
Roamright,Process is fairly simple.  Haven't needed to use any of this insurance yet but the process of purchasing and the plans are fine.,5
Roamright,"The process was fairly easy, but the customer service is what deserved the 5 stars. They were courteous, helpful and most of all understanding. The process did take a few weeks, but very happy with the outcome. Would highly recommend!",5
Roamright,I never got to travel because of the Pandemic.  So this turned out to be a total waste of money to cover my husband and I for a year of coverage.  Perhaps you should have contact customers who purchased this policy to tell them about prorating.  This was the first year I had ever purchased such a policy and had no idea pro rated was even an option.,3
Roamright,"I was an unfortunate vacationer who planned a trip 6 moths in advanced and then a global pandemic hit its peak as I was in Peru. I was physically quarantined and it was a terrifying time for me. Roam right was able to cover me for the expenses I accrued. While there were misunderstandings at first, we were able to work it out. I understand the pandemic was an unprecedented event and they probably have never had to deal with something like this before. But they handled it wonderfully in the end. Hooi was my claim specialist and I appreciate her patience with me. I would recommend this company.",5
Roamright,"I am very disappointed with your policy of not refunding the premiums paid when the pandemic started in March.  I believe a refund was allowed only if requested within 2 weeks of purchase.  Obviously, this did not allow a refund for the vast majority of your clients.  You had the opportunity to do the right thing and amend your refund requirements because of the pandemic but you failed in compassion.  I am out two payments for paid trips to Scotland and Budapest.  Keep the money, bathe in your greed.  You will never see another penny from me!",1
Roamright,I am not sure how good Arch RoamRight is since I did not have an opportunity to make a claim to see how good they are.,4
Roamright,"Horrible experience, I will never use them again in the future.They have drugged me for now just about 5 months, and going.  They refuse to provide a refund because the travel agent chose to ignore their request to confirm that i did not get any refunds or credits for 4 months.Now that i finally got the travel agent to respond back confirming i did not get any refund or credits, they are telling me that it is not enough information to get the refund.  Always they bring new requirements.  They make you exaughausted so you just give up.Criminals in action.Stay Away!——-Response your comment ;That is not the case. As I have expressed to you, I have paid the travel agent a fee To provide me with a full refund, they said it will take 30 days. It has now been almost 70 days and they still did not issue a refund.  They will continue to drag their feet and say they will attempt to provide a refund, but in reality nothing is happening since I’ve waited over two months just for the cancellation.  You guys told me over the phone that even if it takes them a year you do not care until they provide an email saying they will refused to refund. Well they don’t want to send that email because it is in their best interest to recoup a cancellation fee From my credit card when they plan to give a refund, but clearly this is not possible for them. As I have provided you tons of documents this travel agent is a crook and they won’t even bother to spend the time to send me an email telling me they will not refund me to satisfy your needs. Do you have the phone number do you have all the information and you clearly know that I have not gotten a refund. These tickets go all the way back to February 2020, how much more should customer wait to get a refund when purchasing insurance from you.I highly suggest that no one will buy insurance from your company because they are throwing their money away. Your policy is ridiculous and no customer should go through this sort of pain you’re causing.I did not get a refund from the travel agent as you have confirmed nor does it seem like they will give me a refund. I followed your instructions by paying them hundreds of dollars to cancel and refund as you can see it’s been 70 days and dishes done nothing, yet you still continue do not refund my rightful claimIf you care about your customers why don’t you reach out to them and tell them to simply close out the refund process because nothing is coming from them and then you can refund me through my insurance I purchased from you",1
Roamright,"I am rating the service 'poor' because it took eight months to resolve a straight forward situation.  I'm giving two stars rather than one only because it was finally paid in full.  My claim was for trip cancellation expenses. All of the required documents were included with the initial claim submission.  It took 30 days to receive a response which asked for ALL of the supporting documents.  I called and spoke to an adjuster who pulled the file and confirmed that all of them had been received. Five days later I got another email asking for some of the same information.  Again, I called and spoke to someone who confirmed that it had been there all along.Two weeks later, I received a letter denying the claim.  It cited an exclusion for 'illness' imposed by the company for all policies issued after a certain date. The exclusion was not contained in the policy nor had it been otherwise  communicated to me or to the travel agent who placed the coverqge. In a conversation with the adjuster, it was explained that the exclusion it was for COVID 19.  My claim had nothing to do with that. It also cited failure to negotiate a refund from the trip operator. I had provided a copy of the contract with the tour company that clearly stated the trip cancellation terms.  I had cancelled after the expiration of the refund period.I immediately appealed the decision.  Two and a half months later, I received a second denial based on a completely different reason. The communication stated that this time they had done a 'thorough review' and it cited the pre-existing conditions exclusion as the basis for denial.  The confirmation of benefits issued at the time coverage was bound clearly stated that the exclusion was waived.  Apparently, they had not done a 'thorough review' this time either.I appealed again.  For the next 60 days, I made several attempts to learn the status of the appeal.  I was promised several calls from the management team, but never actually received one.  Finally I got notification that the claim was being paid in full.  A week later, I received a check.While I am happy to have been paid finally, I should not have been subjected to excessive delays and been given reasons for denial that were not supported by the policy.  I understand that any claim must be completely validated.  However, this experience leads me to believe that they were just buying time hoping that I would go away.  I would definitely not recommend Arch RoamRight for travel insurance.",2
Roamright,"This experience with Arch Roam Right was so positive, your staff should teach a course on customer service.  Sarah worked with travel agent to determine eligibility for claim. Professional, helpful, knowledgeable.  Stacia completed the claim, maintaining her professionalism, patience, kindness and helpfulness.  Your team answered my many questions, phone calls, inquiries with such patience, never making me feel like a bother.  Communication was key and maintained throughout the entire process.  Thank you to all, especially to Stacia, who shared her expertise, while maintaining her professionalism and completed the claim.",5
Roamright,we lost a family member to cancer a week before our trip. the vacation rental company would not refund us any of our  money $5K. Thank god for trip insurance we purchased through  Arch. The were professional and easy to work with they did exactly what the said they would. helping us cancel and to get our funds back!,5
Roamright,"This was my first time buying travel insurance. I kept having this feeling that I needed to buy insurance due to all the hurricanes and due to Covid. I am so glad I did. 4 days before our trip our family tested positive. We received our money back in a little over a week. I filled everything out they requested. I got back every dollar. I would have wanted more than anything to have went on our trip instead, but I’m thankful we were covered. I will never not buy travel insurance again.",5
Roamright,Roan Right has been security in my mind. Thank God no need for use. Have held back renewing since we cannot predict when we can travel again safely.,5
Roamright,"Thanks RoamRight. It was my first time buying travel insurance and I'm very glad I did. I got sick during my vacation and had to spend a week in hospital. RoamRight took care of everything. Someone even called to ensure I was well enough to return home, otherwise they would arrange the changes. Thankfully they didn't have to. Though I was ill for half of my vacation, RoamRight made it happy. Thank you",4
Roamright,"We purchased travel insurance in March 2019 for a trip to Israel in October 2020.  Due to the pandemic, the tour company cancelled the tour since Israel was closed to US citizens.  Our claim was denied claimingwe were not covered for closed borders.  This doesn't seem fair since they knew it was an international destination and the Israel government prohibited us from entering.",1
Roamright,RoamRight's claim process was very straightforward and their customer service was excellent.  I appreciated the frequent communication regarding the claim status and that I was able to reopen my claim after the credit card company closed my dispute case.  I will certainly use them again for travel insurance.,5
Roamright,we have used roamright for three years never a claim but easy to get them on your side,5
Roamright,"While with the onset of COVID, my plans were in jeopardy, and ultimately travel had to be canceled, I applied my deposit for the trip to rescheduled plans, and due to cancellation of flights, suffered no loss.  So then the policy was simply insurance unused, but valued as insurance.  Cannot then comment on performance against policy.  I will say I intend to use Arch RoamRight again to cover the rescheduled trip.  Only negative is the premium placed on age of traveller, although it is understandable that risk goes up with age in general, as they say, 70 is the new 50.",4
Roamright,"Over 2 years, I had to use my insurance twice, when the airline lost my luggage and the next year when the cruise line lost my luggage.  I was compensated for the full amount of my covered insurance.  It sure made those tough experiences a lot easier.",5
Roamright,"Did not pay what they say in policy.Agent was not good, underwriters. They are not good at all.Never buy travel  insurance.",1
Roamright,Do not purchase insurance from this company. They don't pay.  Company is bad faith with a large number of claims and seem to have no intention of paying.,1
Roamright,"It is an excellent service, reliable and safe, the careful attention and attentive to answering any questions that one has",5
Roamright,"the representative was very knowledgeable, patient and answer all my questions.",5
Roamright,great insurance but we have not had to use itBut it's nice to be prepaired,5
Roamright,"The customer service with RoamRight was fantastic. They walked me through my benefits and addressed all of my concerns, so I was aware what I was covered for. It made me feel comfortable traveling during this global pandemic. I will definitely use them again.",5
Roamright,"I had 6 clients I booked together under VPI they had to cancel due to medical issues. 3 automatically got refunded without any asking for documentation from the physician,while my other 3 haven't been refunded anything but asking for documentation. My question is why you didn't ask all for documentation when they are all booked under the same insurance. How can I explain to them and they asking how their daughter got refunded and they didn't. Arch giving me the run-around. This is ridiculous. Also arch said they haven't refunded any of them yet and saying it's pending when three have been refunded.",2
Roamright,I purchased this insurance but due to COVID airlines are not refunding the money and the insurance will also not refund. Complaining to US DOT also not helped.  As usual the consumer is forced to pay.,1
Roamright,This is why to buy insurance for any trip. Our family trip would involve flying and with Covid and a previous medical condition didn't want to risk it.,4
Roamright,This company failed to reimburse travel costs for a trip that was cancelled due to COVID 19 despite the fact we had “Cancel for any Reason” coverage and purchased the coverage prior to the existence of COVID 19.  The company would not reimburse the premium or allow for a premium credit on another trip.,1
Roamright,"Excellent customer service from Melanie.  I had to wait a long time before the organization running my trip, scheduled for October, officially cancelled the trip and therefore I did not contact Arch until mid August regarding a refund of the cost of my trip insurance.  I honestly expected there was little hope of getting offered any compensation for the cost, but I was offered a pro rated refund or a full credit towards purchasing trip insurance within the next 2 years. The pro rated refund was small due to the fact that I cancelled more than 8 months after purchasing the policy, so I opted for the full credit.  When there was an issue with processing this, Melanie was more than apologetic and went out of her way to make things right.  Thank you Arch - I will definitely purchase my trip insurance through you in the future.",5
Roamright,"I purchase insurance to cover should I become sick that our medical and/or expenses for the trip be reimbursed.Our trip coverage was from 06-06-2020 to 06-15-2020. On 06-05-2020, I became sick with COVID-19 symptoms.  I continued to have more as the week went on.  According to the CDC, if you have COVID-19 symptoms you should self isolate and not travel.  I started running fever and called to have a test done for positive COVID-19.  I got one on 06-13-2020.  I called by Dr and he and the local health dept said I could not travel.  I filed a claim with ARCH Romright and was denied.  I appealed and still was denied the cost of my trip airline tickets.  My wife also tested positive for COVID-19.  So I guess they love to take your money but when it comes to having to pay,they do not want to. I have purchase insurance every time I travel but this will be the last time I do so.",1

Roamright,a friendly helpful service person resolved my issue of changing the dates of my trip,5
Roamright,I was not thrilled at how they handled Covid at all as it had not even gotten to the shutdown point when I purchased my insurance. Luckily my credit cards and the company I was traveling with reimbursed me — and the only money I lost was what I put towards a useless travel insurance policy.Update: I received a blanket email from the company indicating that they are not covering cancellations so I did not contact them and never received any additional information about changed policies. I will look into this now.,3
Roamright,"Pleasant, efficient service.  Patient with my many questions.  :)",5
Roamright,"We had never had long term travel insurance before in any of our 30+ years of travel.  And, we have never had an incident that we needed to file a claim before, so that worked out well for us.Something told us to not take any more chances, so we bought a RoamRight policy.  Well, guess what happened on our first cruise after purchase?  The ship arrived late forcing us to change our return flight home.  RoamRight took care of the change fees. No extra money for us. Nice! So we decided to renew for another year.  Well, low and behold, we lost our cell phone in a JFK airport lounge.  No problem, Roamright took care of that!  Well, we didn't get money very quickly, but we did get what we call a fair amount of money.In the future, when we can travel again, I definitely will continue to buy a yearly policy thru RoamRight.  It's worth the piece of mind, especially in these crazy travel days which I hope will come soon.",5
Roamright,"Letter from Doctor not accepted, only their long Physicians Statement costing me another $175 which they did not reimburse me for. So from now on I would insure $200 over what the travel costs are to get back was your entitled to. Also if you don't bank with Chase, you need to ask for a check instead of Electronic payment.  I helped my brother and used my email, so the payment came to my email address since I bank with Chase, and I had to pay my brother from my account.",4
Roamright,"The staff on the phone were very helpful and friendly each time I called.  They answered the phone promptly without much wait time, which I truly appreciated.  I had to change the dates of my trip twice and it was a very easy process.  My trip is complete, and luckily I did not have a claim to process, so I can't speak to that...but on the front end I was very pleased with the service.",5
Roamright,"Well, the trip never happened because of COVID.  Even though the trip was in August and canceled in March (by the various hosts - Carnival, Marriott, etc...) still had to pay the insurance.  Insurance companies and attorneys have a special place in hell and in my heart!!  Gotta love em.  Money grubbing scoundrels.  Be aware, after your cancelation period is up, it doesn't matter if the insurance company burns down or everything goes to hell (which it did) you are losing the premium even if what you are paying for has been canceled at no cost to you.",1
Roamright,"We tried to travel in March, 2020, but the trip fell apart because of the quarantines. We had bought travel insurance with RoamRight in November, 2019, & they did reimburse us for the unused portion of the trip. The start of the online application process could be clearer, I think, but our claims agent was very capable, sorted it out for me, & kept me up to date on the progress of the claim. I was very pleased that RoamRight came through for us in spite of the incredible chaos in the travel industry during the pandemic. Thank you, RoamRight!",5
Roamright,"Italy was under complete lockdown during the dates of our travel. Yet, Arch RoamRight refused to honor the claim. They claimed that 'fear of getting sick is not covered.' How can one go to Italy if there is complete lockdown? I told them to give me in writing that Lockdown was not covered. They refused. I would never buy insurance from them again.",1
Roamright,"Although we never had cause to use or file a claim against our annual multi-trip policy just having it provided ""peace of mind"".",5
Roamright,"We filed a claim under our Trip Cancellation policy.  Completing the claim form on-line made the process easy and Arch Roam Right kept us up to date on the claims process via e-mail. When I had questions, the Customer ServiceRepresentatives were available, friendly and knowledgeable.  The most important factor was we had saved all of our documentation from the moment we started our trip plans. This helped when filing our claim. I would recommend Roam right without hesitation!",5
Roamright,"Ironically, the cruise line cancelling the trip is not a covered reason!  The reason for denying the claim is that there was no strike and no inclement weather.  I definitely would never purchase any type of insurance through them again.",1
Roamright,"I submitted a claim, my first claim ever for travel, on May 7th, 2020. I heard from RoamRight often about the claim. On March 26th I got a request for more information. On June 9th they asked for more information. They acknowledged that they received all the information the same day. From that day until July 2 or 3rd, not sure which one, I did not hear from them again. That is when I called them to find out the status of the claim. When I tried to find out the status of the claim I was not given a very clear answer. They hemmed and hawed around, but really provided an answer that they had not heard from the company I booked the trip with. I asked if they had made more than one enquiry, but they could not provide me with an answer. Service has been horrible. They are not able or willing to share much information. They sure were willing to take my monies for premiums for the years I was with them, and have sent me letters that my coverage is expiring, now expired.",1
Roamright,Had to contact the travel agent to get this processed. I didn’t give her any more data than you and somehow she got it processed. It was a school trip and you gave me a hard time for $70.  Ridiculous.,2
Roamright,Did not claim anything from RoamRight since the travel agency credited our cancelled trip for future travel due to C19 Pandemic.,5
Roamright,No review text found,5
Roamright,Over 30 days and no resolution. I need my money.,1
Roamright,"I am updating my review. Horrible company, I purchased a cancel for any reason policy and couldn't fly due to covid. They denied my claim completely and paid me ZERO. This is a scam! Beware and do not purhcase anything from them.",1
Roamright,"We normally use RoamRight for our international travel but I can no longer recommend them, will no longer use them, and will be advising our travel associations and groups to seek alternative coverage, Allianz for example.In March, while we were in Singapore, several days before our Singapore Air ticket would continue on to Paris, with a 2 night stay at a non-refundable hotel followed by flight home on TAP (all booked before COVID was a known pandemic) with RoamRight coverage also purchased far in advance of the pandemic. The route from Singapore to Paris was suspended, and an EU travel ban was also enacted for travel from EU to the US. This required going in to Singapore Air's office (phone lines were busy, but since we were near the office we could stop by) and were given the only alternative of flying directly to SFO or LAX. We chose the SFO option, used Southwest points to get home from there, and were told it would cost a total of $1620 for the two of us.We were informed this morning by RoamRight that they 100% denied our claim for the air travel, unusable Paris hotel, and hotel in San Francisco required as part of our getting home, with the exception of a paltry sum of $63.85 for toll charges and food after months of calling to check status and providing documentation (the same documentation that was uploaded on the initial form, so I don't know what their internal process is that they lost the documentation the first time).Clearly RoamRight's main goal was to figure out how to pay out less than our premium payment, and it looks like they pulled it off.  They just threw out infinite future premium payments from us in exchange for a one-time reprieve in payment.Seek alternative insurance if you are considering travel.",1
Roamright,"I boked my original policy back in 2016 for a cruise in 2019.  When it became apparent a couple of months prior to my scheduled departure that this new cruise ship would not be ready in time due to construction delays Arch RoamRight was very cooperative in moving my coverage to 2020.Now to due COVID19 my replacement cruise was canceled.  Therefore I needed to move this cruise to June of 2022.   This was beyond the normal time frame for an extension.However, the entire Arch RoamRight team from the rep Jennifer, to her supervisor and the team director   worked together to find a solution that allowed me to maintain my same coverages.I truly appreciate them going the extra mile to provide coverage.To notch service.",5
Roamright,"Cruise line canceled trip for which we were recently scheduled due to the Covid19 pandemic. Requested and successfully received credit voucher from RoamRight for future use within the timeframe I was seeking. Found their representatives to be friendly, professional and helpful.",5
Roamright,"This Claim process with Arch RoamRight was a frustrating and prolonged ordeal. All Claim criteria was met and documentation submitted in early March, 2020. After many, many calls and emails, the threat of action through FL Consumer Protection Agencies, and involvement by a representative of Squaremouth, reimbursement was finally received in mid-June, 2020. It appeared that Arch RoamRight did everything they could to avoid paying the Claim. I understand that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted everyone, but my Claim was not due to COVID-19, and I could never get a straight answer from any Arch RoamRight Rep regarding my claim or status until just recently.",2
Roamright,"What a horrible company. I was stuck in Europe because of Covid-19 shut downs. Couldn't get get home at all. My flight was cancelled. Finally I had to book a $1200 U.S. Embassy fight home and incurred many additional expenses, but they say nothing is covered. Thank you you for nothing during this worldwide pandemic.",1
Roamright,We had a trip planned in February.  My husband was hospitalized 2 days before our departure.  So I had to cancel the trip. I filed my claim and I still haven't received my refund.  This is aggravating!!!!,1
Roamright,I have used RoamRight for every vacation since 2012.  I have always purchased the cancel for any reason upgrade.  Unfortunately I have had a medical situation come up which was a covered reason and Roam Right handled my claim quickly and efficiently.  I also had a personal emergency in which I had to cancel another trip.  I used my cancel for any reason and again they handled the claim quickly and efficiently.  I currently have a claim pending due to cancellation of my trip by the hotel due to Covid 19.  I am not sure what the outcome will be it I do trust it will be handled per their policy language and conditions.  I would  recommend Roam Right for your travel insurance needs.,5
Roamright,I had an annual plan and fortunately did not have to use it. The plan was very easy to understand and to enroll online. No problems.,4
Roamright,I used your company for a few time. It was good.I cancelled my policy in March because the Covid-19 .I did not get the refund.,3
Roamright,"My sister and I had an international trip planned for the end of May. Due to Covid 19 we were unable to go. I reached out to Roam Right and they have offered a credit toward insurance on another trip. I only have the email stream to prove that, if we are able to take the trip next year. We have used Roam Right in the past but had no trouble on the trip so had no claim. Hopefully, this credit will be available when we need it.",4
Roamright,Trip was cancelled due to pandemic-did not get premium back for insurance although insurance not needed as there was not any trip,2
Roamright,"I purchased a cancel for any reason policy for my trip to Europe. Then Covid hit and I couldn't even travel if I wanted to. I figured this would be an easy claim, but it's been very slow.  I filed my claim in 3 months ago and am still waiting for my refund. I totally understand they've had a huge volume, however,  the process is really poor. 1) When I filed my claim the form did NOT ask me to provide any documentation. I waited weeks and finally called in to be told it was in the queue. When I did speak to a rep, after calling in again, I was asked to provide a number of documents.  which I then had to chase down. I got those submitted within a few days and thought I'd be good. However it then needs to go to another level of review which puts me at the back of the line AGAIN. Still waiting for my refund. The communications they send me are merged forms, which is fine, but they contain NO information and thus require me to call in and find out why exactly they're sending me something. You can imagine the amount of volume in calls they're getting. I was told they have a very small staff (12 people?) not sure why they can't hire more to get the job done. I will say the customer service is good, every person I've spoken with is very nice, very concerned with helping however the website, email, and actual processes set up for claims and updates those are  way below average. I struggled to give them 3 stars.",3
Roamright,"I was disappointed to learn that due to this being a pandemic, RoamRight will not reimburse me for hotel and airlines that are only willing to hold my reservation.",1
Roamright,"our trip had been cancelled twice ,roam right was informed of the changes which was reconsidered and moved to the new dates.No change in purchased amount.",5
Roamright,The one time I needed answers defined about the policy I was just given the section of the policy to read again.. I already did that...,3
Roamright,"Was stupid of you to ask for us to provide when and how we put down a deposit so you could process our claim. We had paid this down payment more than a year ago.Our travel agent could provide you that we had paid it and you have records of the same.For us to have to call credit card company to get a statement to provide you be for processing is moronic! This, after we had to get paperwork from doctors and pay them $50 for processing too.It’s just a way for you to hope people give up, throw up their hands and let you keep the money.",3
Roamright,"Quick and easy change of dates to our travel policy, and better yet -- no wait in a phone queue!",5
Roamright,"I was happy that my claim was resolved favorably, but disappointed that it tookintervention by my travel agent to get a favorable conclusion.",4
Roamright,"My Claim #TVLC71629820 has been pending since 3/11/2020. I received an email from Shannon on 3/28 asking for supplemental documents and I provided requested documents. Since then the claim is pending with no further updates. I have followed-up with Shannon multiple times and received no response.I understand the huge workload on travel insurance these days, but I would still appreciate a simple email update so at least I know someone will be working on it sometime later as opposed to the current absolute silence!This is my passive way of asking for some attention on my claim. I will be happy to change this to a 5-star review once my claim is resolved.",3
Roamright,"Jennifer was helpful, professional, and knowledgable...a pleasure to work with",5
Roamright,"Roam Rite came through in the end, but after unnecessary delays caused by the employee who was dealing with the claim repeatedly failing to read or understand the circumstances described in the email sent with the claim forms.First she replied that I had already been paid - but that was for an earlier trip cancelled on the multi-trip policyThen she indicated the cancelled trip was beyond the expiration date of the policy, ignoring the fact the trip was covered for cancellation prior to departure as long as the cancellation was before the policy expiration.It took a call to a supervisor to get the claim on track. The person handling it was clearly incompetent.",3
Roamright,"We have been totally impressed with your service.  My wife fell down stairs while we were in NIce, France.  She fractured four bones in her left ankle and left wrist which required 3 days of hospitalization, surgery, confinement to a wheel chair, follow-up appointments, change of our pre-paid housing arrangements [needed housing that would accommodate a wheel chair], and more.  We have never used travel insurance, but purchased it for a little additional peace of mind...just in case!  I contacted RoamRight to report the injury and was so very impressed with the personalized attention we received in the form of follow-up emails, phone calls, etc., just to check in and see how healing was going, whether we needed a change in flight arrangements to the U.S., etc.  The personalized attention was far more than I expected.  We stayed in France until our scheduled departure back to the U.S. [about three weeks] because of the injuries and needed follow-up.  After our primary insurance paid its share of the medical expenses, RoamRight quickly and efficiently handled the balance [i.e., hospital E.R., prescriptions, additional hotel charges due to the need for a handicapped room, wheelchair].  Although the company offered upgrades for the flights home, it was not necessary.  When Covid-19 ends and we travel once again, RoamRight will be traveling with us.  Thank you...you really helped take some of the sting out of our unfortunate accident.",5
Roamright,I have no idea how you came up with my amount.  I lost $500.00 dollars but you only gave me $250.00 with no explanation.   I want to know why.,1
Roamright,"Your insurance product is well designed for our needs.  We are most concerned with medical and evacuation coverage on our travels.   Purchasing your coverage was easy and convenient over the internet.  And, the price is right.",5
Roamright,"The last email from you asked for more paperwork, I sent it and am still waiting an answer.",3
Roamright,"We received a prompt reimbursement for our European cruise due to medical reasons. I figured it would be delayed to August or September due to the covid issues, but we received the checks in May. They are very efficient.",5
Roamright,"This insurance was a waste of money. I spent over $500 dollars on this insurance and when I needed it they had all kinds of reasons why I didn't qualify. Better read all the fine print. Don't expect any reimbursement unless you have one of the main reasons. We had to reschedule our flight because of my wife's job, and got nothing. Expensive insurance, and no help at all.",1
Roamright,"I have purchased Arch Roam Right travel insurance policies several times and have always enjoyed a good experience, even when I filed a claim. I just spoke with Kathy who was extremely helpful and professional in accommodating a change to a policy based on changes in travel plans due to the current Covid-19 problem. Based on my experience with this company I can say they have earned my trust for future travel insurance needs.",5
Roamright,Customer Service person was very good and easy to work with.,5
Roamright,It may be understandable from a business orientation but after purchasing this product for many years you are expected to be dropped due to age. The advertisement clearly states this but I still believe it is inappropriate..,1
Roamright,Very disappointed. Our trip got canceled and your saying we are not covered.,1
Roamright,"We were denied our claim for trip interruption when the cruise company suddenly ended our trip.  Since we had not returned to our city of departure, we had to purchase return tickets...very expensive.  Told that they did not cover Covid-19 claims.  Our insurance was purchased in November 2019.  I reread the policy and could not find any evidence of exclusion for a worldwide Pandemic and this certainly was not an act of G-d.  We are appealing the decision.",2
Roamright,"So sad to see that our trip had to be cancelled due to the Coronavirus. Even more sad to learn that the insurance we had purchased for trip cancellation did not cover our losses. Moral of the story, if you buy the insurance, read the fine print and probably get legal advice before you pay your money. Things are not always what you think.",2
Roamright,"Great people working for them, had to change dates and it was no problem",5
Roamright,"I recently coordinated a trip with 23 travelers to the UK, ALL of whom purchased cancellation insurance through Arch RoamRight. We were forced to cancel after the UK was shut down due to COVID-19 just two days before our departure date. Currently, Arch is refusing ANY reimbursement for ANY of the travelers. One of the worst experiences in my 28 years of coordinating group travel. Buyer beware!Arch RoamRight replied to my concern stating that my situation was not covered by the policy. Let me quote directly from the cancellation policy that 23 families purchased:""Some examples of covered reasons include:(Example #2) Being quarentined . . . ""Both the city of origin and the destination city were under complete quarantine at the time of departure and for the duration of the scheduled trip.Arch RoamRight needs to do the ""Right"" thing and reimburse these families who believed they were using your services to protect the investment of this trip.",1
Roamright,My family had a trip to Jamaica scheduled for June.  Had to reschedule due to the Coronavirus.  Emailed yesterday to push the travel dates out 1 year and the next morning i had an email in my inbox with a new confirmation and pleasant message from customer service.  Super service even in this busy time!,5
Roamright,"We were not able to go on our vacation due to Covid19.  I sent an email asking about a refund or credit and got no response.  We have a voucher to reschedule our flight, but it looks like we'll be using a different company for our travel insurance.",2
Roamright,Friendly and helpful staff.  Unfortunately I wasn’t able to send supporting documents with application on the website.  I mailed copies of documents by usps and the Arch RoamRight helped me finish my application.,4
Roamright,"We have used the company numerous times; however this time we were unable to travel out of country or anywhere, we sent an email asking for a credit for our next trip and haven't had a response. It is a shame because we paid $208 for absolutely going no place. As an essential worker I wasn't able to proceed with my travel plans, I didn't want a refund only a credit.",2
Roamright,"I didn't use my RoamRight coverage, because my trip was cancelled because of the COVID-19. The purchase of the coverage was easy, and the options and prices were very good. I'll definitely look for RoamRight when I'm able to travel again.",5
Roamright,"So, my claim date of service was 12/16/19. The problem happened while I was on a cruise ship. I waited to file until I returned home 5 days later. Anyway, about a month went by and heard nothing about my claim, so I called to inquire what was going on with it. So the person that answered the phone put me on a short hold to check on it. When she returned she told me that I must first file the claim with Medicare and be turned down and also with my supplement insurance and be turned down and then the underwriter would take a look at my claim. So, my reply to her was, why wouldn’t the underwriter either call or send me an email telling me what she just said? She didn’t know why that had happened. So, I did those things which took about a month to get a turndown from Medicare and another month to get a turndown from my supplement insurance. So, finally on April 2nd, 2020 I finally received an email from the RoamRight underwriter that my claim has been processed and approved for payment. I haven’t received the payment yet, but will be interesting to see how long that takes!",3
Roamright,Good value for policy. Assuming it would work as described if needed and save the day.,5
Roamright,"I did not need my policy, but it was comforting to know I would have been taken care of if I did.Had I actually used it, I would have given it 5 stars.",4
Roamright,RoamRight is a great insurance to have on your vacation and there if needed.,5
Roamright,"I had to cancel our trip recently and it was a painfree, smooth process.  The claim was processed quickly and efficiently.  Thanks for another excellent experience!!",5
Roamright,"fast response ,good customer service",5
Roamright,It was easy to get and add to the travel insurance for my trip. Luckily I did not need to make a claim.I used to be able to use this company because I took a tour through a company they had an arrangement with. For future trips they allowed me to get insurance on a grandfather basis. I have now been advised that this past trip is the last I will be able to grandfather in. But then there may never be anymore travel for anyone.,4
Roamright,"Arch RoamRight  refunded our trip costs in full, once all of our paperwork was submitted.  I would have given 5 stars, but if you are not computer-savvy, this would have been a difficult process.  If there was an option to mail in the documentation, that was not obvious to me.  Computer skills needed that I didn't possess were :  scanning written documents, and changing a Word document to an acceptable format, like .pdf.  I couldn't understand why the Word document would not upload.  Fortunately my husband is very computer-savvy, and realized right away that he had to change the designation to a type of document the website supported.  And perhaps there is phone assistance or online help for this.",4
Roamright,"Easy to use site, good company to deal with",5
Roamright,Excellent service getting the insurance and brought peace of mind for our trip.,5
Roamright,Fortunately we did not have to use the policy.  The ease of booking was wonderful and the peace of mind that we had it made our trip enjoyable.,5
Roamright,Felt comfortable with knowing that I had a number we could call in case of an emergency and that you would take care of dealing with the party at my end.,4
Roamright,It was easy to set up and go,5
Roamright,"What matters most, worked.  1) the cost was good for this product.  2) it was easy to get done, 3) when I had questions, they were answered quickly and professionally.And, 4) not for me, but for a fellow traveler, they paid for healthcare oversees when a claim was made.HIGHLY recommend this !",5

Roamright,"What an amazing company.  Unfortunate circumstances came up and we had to cancel our trip.  Thank goodness we had trip insurance. This company made it so easy to submit a claim and upload documents, but more importantly when I had questions they were spectacular.  It was easy to get through to someone and the customer service was top notch.   The people I spoke to were pleasant, helpful and well informed.",5
Roamright,Had a simple claim onboard ship. My granddaughter had a bladder innfection and went to ship daughter. Did a analysis and Medicine. 260.00 chg. Filed claim with this company. They lost the claim number one. Three months later they denied claim. They are terrible! Take your money but want pay when you need them. Beware of this company! Have turned them in to State Board of Insurance for false policy advertising! What is sad is I am a licensed agent with them and sold their policy. First claim turned in. Fortunately was my claim and not a client.Just a terrible insurance company to deal with!!! They responded saying needed proof of no claim to primary physician. On there claim form it was clearly stated had no primary physician and no coverage for such. Their claim process is terrible! Had to call three times after the fact they lost my claim. Been in the insurance business for 30 years and very familiar with these type companies that find ways not to pay their claims by not responding and not following their policy rules. I will continue to pass along to all potential clients. If you look at top ten trip cancellation companies they are not on that list pretty well explains why. The excuse they used when replying to this was a lie... be aware of this company owned by some Bermuda company...will not pay their claims! They cheap their insureds!,1
Roamright,"Excellent service provided by Daniella reasonable prices, We used them before for our trip to Iceland, unfortunately I got sick, and, had no problem getting reimbursed. Highly recommend Arch.",5
Roamright,I was pleasantly surprised how quickly they took care of my claim. It took awhile to get all the supporting documents as my traveling partner & I were in different states. Once we did everything seemed to go smoothly.,5
Roamright,I have used Roam Right for our yearly trips out of the country and Thank Goodness have never had to use it. Chatted online with Skyler and she made the process very easy to obtain another policy for my upcoming trip.,5
Roamright,Never leave home without it. Feel secure that if something happens Roam Right is there for us. Only had to use once for medical and Roam Right covered everything.,5

Roamright,Handled our claim promptly and explained benefit approvals and denials clearly.,5
Roamright,I provided all the information for my claims.   I received an acknowledgement for the claims and a few days later a status update.   This is exactly what I would expect from a reputable company.   The claims were processed and payments were sent to me in a timely manner.   Very happy with the service.   I have recommended this company to my friends.,5
Roamright,"Peace of mind is hard to put a value on. But that is the primary reason we purchase travel insurance. And our cycling and hiking tours usually require it. But when you need it, it’s priceless. When our hotel room was broken into and some of our gear and electronics stolen, Roam Right was right there. I was able reach them by phone easily from a somewhat remote location in South America. Their calm, cool representative helped us take the necessary recovery steps. They seamlessly connected us with our bank and credit card companies. And in the end, they were there to ease the financial bite. As the TV ad says, we wouldn’t leave home without it.",5
Roamright,"Never had a problem.  We figured with insurance, we would not need it.  If we didn't have the insurance, we would most likely have problems.",5
Roamright,A big thank you for servicing my policy so fast.  Its only been 3 weeks since I sent the info to you.  My doctor took longer to fill the form out.  Thank you.,4
Roamright,"I am impressed that roam right didn’t terminate my claim as it took a very long time for me to get the supporting documents to them. I happen to have a lot of things going on in my life at the moment and this claim seemed like the least important thing to me. So I just kept pushing it aside. But they kept gently reminding me and ultimately, when I got them the documents several months later, they paid the claim. I am very impressed.",5
Roamright,"The policy was easy to set up, and the staff modified the dates of coverage later with no hassle or extra charge. I'm happy.",5
Roamright,Great customer service! I highly recommend them.,5
Roamright,"We had to cancel our trip due to the death of a close family member, and RoamRight really came through for us. The claims process was simple and conducted entirely through the online portal. They gave me peace of mind during a very difficult time, and I am grateful to them for that.",5
Roamright,"What happens when a claim is submitted.....I have purchased Roam Right policies for 16 trips and have found that making payments for policies is efficient and I felt I could confidently travel.However, when I submitted a relatively small claim for an ER visit in Romania ($100) they refunded less than half of the amount submitted.They stated I had a $50 deductible when my ""Elite"" policy clearly said in print, "" 0 deductible"". Also, they denied a hand written taxi receipt ($12) for transport to the ER. Try getting a printed receipt from a taxi driver in Romania who doesn't speak English - when your head is bleeding profusely on the way to the ER. Is it not reasonable to assume I traveled from my apartment address to the ER in some fashion.So, while everything feels great when you pay them and get what you think is a safety net of coverage, they actually nickel and dime you when you submit even the smallest of claims.Edit 2/12: While I would have preferred not spending any time trying to recover what was due, I’ve raised this rating to a 3 for Roam Right’s quick response (below), and correction of claim payment.",3

Roamright,"For full disclosure, I have never had to file a claim.  That said, I have had a multi-trip annual policy with Roamright for several years and it brings peace of mind to know we are covered as we travel the world.  The company is easy to deal with over the phone, representatives are thorough and well trained, and the experience has been very pleasant.",5
Roamright,Made a bad situation manageable. I would use this company again. I met requirements as stated in the policy and Roam Right lived up to their end of the policy.,5

Roamright,"My sister travelled with me to Europe where she had a medical issue that resulted in a bill for $5000. Medicare paid a portion of it. She and I both purchased Roam Right annual insurance. She submitted the balance to Roam Right. Fortunately, we made sure that she got the full documentation of her care and charges, so her bill was paid right away. She was very impressed with the caring customer service.A Roam Right rep even called her to be sure that she didn't have any additional expenses that she failed to submit.",5
Roamright,"As unfortunate as it was to have to file a claim since we were not able to get off of work, the experience with Roamright travel insurance was excellent. It was very easy to file a claim online, simple to see what documentation was needed, and had a response very quickly. There were no strings or hidden items, was a very straight forward process and the claim was quickly processed.

Roamright,"Not good, I missed a flight because I could not travel with a migrant headache. I couldn't sit up in bed, and couldn't speak the language so I didn't get verification from a doctor. I have reported this to roam right and they haven't responded in 10 days.",1
Roamright,"Purchasing process was simple. No emergency occurred on my trip so no need to contact customer service. It would have been nice to get an email saying, ""hope you enjoy your trip, were here if you need us."" Don't rec any communication after the purchase. The agreement and insurance cards were easy to access and print.",4
Roamright,"This was the first time that I’ve had to make a claim with RoamRight. I filed the claim on January 16, and by January 23, it was completed and my check is on the way. I am blown away by how quickly my claim was paid.  I am a Travel Advisor and this by far has been the easiest and fastest process of any insurance company, myself or my clients have ever experienced. I would strongly suggest RoamRight when you’re purchasing your next travel insurance policy.",5
Roamright,My experience with your insurance coverage has been positive. Insurance forms were clear on needed documentation. E mails informed me of the claim progress. Refund check received today.I am recommending this coverage to my travel agent.Janet Seidman,5
Roamright,"My husband, son and I booked Caravan Travel to Costa Rica on October 31, 2019 for the trip starting date on December 19.  However, I flipped my left on Nov 3 and got a fracture.  Since our departure from USA was on December 18, I waited till December 16 to see whether I will be able to walk.  However the condition didn't improve much as the Podiatrist said it can take even more than three months.  Since the tour is for 9 days with a lot of walking, it was not a good idea to go with the trip.  Son on December 16, I called Caravan and cancelled the trip.  Since we took the Travel Protection Plan while booking the ticket, Caravan refunded the balance after taking the fees and non-refundable charged.  To my surprise they told me that for the flight charges I have to call ArchRoam Right Insurance which I didn't know.  I Called them and have been told to do a claim online which I did.  They need proof of statement from my doctor which the doctor's office faxed them directly and a cancellation proof from the Airlines.  For that I sent them the original booking and the latest status on the original booking since there is no refund only a flight credit.  With in a few days, I got the email from Arch RoamRight saying that the claim has been approved.  Yesterday we received all the refund in the mail.",5
Roamright,Superb Customer Service and they are there when you need them,5
Roamright,"Ultimately our claims got paid, but I cannot say the process was smooth or easy.",3
Roamright,"Thank you for processing our claim so quickly.  We were very disappointed that we were unable to make the Family Cruise which was planned for over a year in advance due to my wife becoming ill.  However, we were very relieved not to have lost the money we paid for the cruise and the airfare, as we could not afford to do so.  Thank you again.",5
Roamright,"Each person I spoke with was helpful, polite and friendly.  I appreciate the good customer service they provided during a stressful time.",5

Roamright,They were helpful and great resolved my issues.,5
Roamright,"We did not have to use our insurance, but was happy we had it.",5
Roamright,I don’t think it was necessary to have to provide Arch with a copy of my original flight plans before the check was issued. They obviously had it since they insured it.  It was just an unnecessary delay and caused me to have to go through a lot of papers in order to find it,3
Roamright,This company is fast and efficient with claims!  Will continue to use them in future trips.  You actually get to speak with real people.  My claim was processed in one week.,5
Roamright,"I had booked a holiday trip for the family, and there were concerns we would be forced to cancel. The folks at RoamRight got me squared away with a policy at a reasonable price online, very easy to complete. Fortunately we did not have to cancel, and had a wonderful vacation. The peace of mind was well worth it.",5
Roamright,"My claim was completed completely, thoroughly, and expeditiously to my satisfaction.  The entire process was executed flawlessly.",5
Roamright,I have been using RoamRight insurance for my trips. It's first time that I need to file claim. Claim process about 30 days. And I received reimbursement! I definitely recommend RoamRight for travel insurance!,5
Roamright,"Thank you so much for your very prompt review of our paperwork.  We were so upset & disappointed when we learned that we would not be able to travel, on our highly anticipated trip, due to health issues.  You understood & refunded our travel expenses in total ... with no questions & very quickly.  You helped ease our pain.",5
Roamright,The process was very easy to follow and the whole procss completed quickly,5
Roamright,"I was very please to have my claim handled in an expeditious manner, as I am awaiting my reimbursement.  All in all, handled in a two month period without any hassles.",5
Roamright,"Felt there system is very time consuming & complex, Had to get additional information several times. Having busy doctors filling out forms is almost impossible & complex.Made you feel like you were trying to get money you didn't deserve. Not happy with insurance at all!",1
Roamright,We had a issue while on vacation. After following the instructions on the site we had no problem receiving the refund we were expecting.,5
Roamright,"I was absolutely stunned at the timely response from Arch to our claim for transportation assistance from Denver to Albuquerque after my wife fell in the hotel and broke her femur.  Just before our Alaska cruise I went online to find a travel insurance policy which seemed to focus on transportation, considering the history of cruise ship issues.  I never expected that the $184.00 premium would pay for a necessary air ambulance because the 10 hour trip by regular ambulance would have been extremely dangerous to my wife.  Thank you Arch for your prompt and appropriate response.",5
Roamright,Appreciated the easy access to customer service on the phone.  Courteous representative answered all my questions.,5
Roamright,"Considering all the crazy things that could happen on a trip, I would never leave home without travel insurance, and RoamRight is one of the best. On a recent trip to Canada is all went sideways... lost bags, missed connections, and sleeping in the hotel at the airport. Roamright covered it all and made it right, to include clothes to get through a few days without bags.",5
Roamright,"I like the emails on the status of our claim. Also, there was a mistake in our original paperwork, but Nelda was very helpful in correcting that problem. We would buy Arch insurance again, and hopefully not use it.",5
Roamright,"Over the past 10 years or so I have insured several trips with Arch Roam Right and this was my 3rd claim. All my claims have been approved with little to no problem, but this was by far the easiest and quickest--less than 2 weeks after submitting my claim by E-mail it was approved.",5
Roamright,"My travel agent was a big help getting together the documents I needed.  I made several phone calls to Roam Right and my questions were always answered.  Once Roam Right received all of my information, my check came quickly.",4
Roamright,Responsive and customer-friendly,5
Roamright,Very helpful customer service prompt response,5
Roamright,I appreciated that the product was easy to obtain and reasonably priced but I never had need to use it - which is what one hopes for with travel insurance.  The only glitch was the flight home and the airline took care of that.  I can't really give a five star review only because I never needed to make a claim.,4
Roamright,"Actually, worst travel insurance I have ever used. Claims denied both times. Even had to get the Attorney General involved. AIG cannot be beat. They are the company I always recommend now. No issues. Great service. Prompt payment.",1
Roamright,"Hands down the best travel insurance company to use. I used them last year, but I didn't need to use the insurance to file a claim. I just wanted to make sure I had it. Fast forward to this year, and I ended up needing to use it. I always pay more for the cancel anytime insurance. Well, my dad got sick shortly before we were set to leave. We knew that he was terminal once he finally got a diagnosis, but we had no idea just how bad off he was. He died exactly two days before we were set to leave. Two weeks before that, he was in the hospital and I knew I couldn't leave my mom with no help. I thought it would just be best to opt to use the cancel anytime and at least get 75 percent back on my nonrefundable costs. It turns out that Roamright took it upon themselves to gently work with me to get some proof of his hospitalization and death so that they could get me back 100 percent of the nonrefundable costs, which they did. The entire claims process took a month and a half from start to finish and I never once had a difficult time dealing with anyone I spoke to.  In fact, they were all incredibly kind and accommodating. I will always use them from now on.",5
Roamright,"I had to cancel my trip.  Claims representatives were professional, polite, courteous, understanding, knowledgeable, and efficient.  They answered my questions, and were very helpful and informative.  Filing the claim was relatively simple.  I received a check in about one month.  I would definitely recommend this insurance company.",5
Roamright,"It was easy to purchase.  Since we had no problems, I don’t know how good the coverage would have been.  Hope to not have to find out.  I’d use it again.Happy travels!",4
Roamright,"Very satisfied, I was so distraught over my situation, and they kept prodding me until I got it right! I can't thank you enough.",5
Roamright,Was very easy to purchase travelers insurance. Best to talk to an agent to better understand your options.?Very affordable and covers what is most needed when traveling out if the country.,5
Roamright,My trip didnt require any claims for Roam Right. But its always nice to have insurance for peace of mind.  Frank,5
Roamright,"I have been purchasing travel medical coverage from Roam Right for years. I like that they have a stand-alone medical plan option, since I have pretty comprehensive travel coverage with my credit card. It is really hard to find just medical plans out there without the added cost of travel coverage. Prices are very reasonable. I have, thankfully, not had to file a claim, so cannot speak to that process, but looking at the reviews from multiple companies, they all seem to have positive and negative feedback. Will continue to be a customer.",5
Roamright,Thank you for your assistance.  You walked me through each step of the information you needed from me.  The check arrived today.I will definitely sign up with you when I take my next cruise in May of 2020.,5
Roamright,"Do not use. When I filed a claim on my ""Cancel for Any Reason Insurance,"" the company found a technical reason not to honor my claim at all.",1
Roamright,"I like the terms of their policies and the pricing is very competive, sometimes a little less that competitors.",5
Roamright,"Documentation required by Roamright for delayed luggage claim: all travel documents confirming travel dates and itinerary; all boarding passes or e-tickets; invoices or receipts for all claimed expenses; cancelled checks, credit card receipts, or other proof of payment; verification of damage from police, hotel, carrier; statement from carrier verifying delay, showing any amounts paid or reimbursed by carrier. All this for a maximum payout of $300. Good luck to all you travelers in foreign countries!",1
Roamright,We appreciate very much how Arch Insurance handled our claim.  They are very dependable and we will always trust them.  Thank you so much for all the help!  - Mr. and Mrs. Virgilio L. del Rosario,5
Roamright,"WOULD GIVE ZERO IF I COULD. I've always purchased travel insurance and have never had an issue when I needed to use it, that is, up until purchasing Arch RoamRight. I submitted a claim due to a medical issue, and you need to be dying for them to accept your claim, and YES, I did have a doctor's note!! I tried to appeal as well and still immediately denied. I will never purchase a policy from this company again and strongly advise all to not either. MUCH BETTER COMPANIES OUT THERE.Update - Arch RoamRight's response is total nonsense. My doctor filled out the form and they denied so you have to be in a hospital or ER for them to cover. Waste of money purchasing this coverage. Never again.",1
Roamright,The claim process is very fast.  I will buy the travel insurance again for  the future trip.,5
Roamright,I did not need to use my insurance. Customer service is very helpful finding right policy,5
Roamright,Easy to get in touch to purchas travel insurance at very affordable rates.,5
Roamright,RoamRight provided excellent customer service and processed my claim in timely manner.  Will definitely book all of my travel insurance with RoamRight going forward.,5
Roamright,"While staying in Paris, my husband fell on the hotel stairs, breaking his left ankle and rupturing his right quadriceps tendon.  I called Roam Right from the ER.  After expressing sympathy and making sure I was alright, the agent gave me excellent advice on what papers to make sure I had before leaving.  Roam Right was in touch everyday as they worked through the process of getting us a flight home and a medical escort to travel with us.  I have no idea how I would have gotten my husband home without their help.  Once home, we were fully reimbursed for our expenses while awaiting our flight and the portion of our trip we were unable to finish.  I highly recommend Roam Right.",5
Roamright,Our trip to Japan was cancelled because of the typhoon. Filling out the claim and submitting the necessary documents on line was easy. Everyone that I spoke to on the phone was friendly and helpful and the information they suppled was easy to understand. The review process was far quicker than I expected based on experiences that friends have had with other carriers. I would absolutely not hesitate to use them again. All of our insured costs were refunded to us.,5
Roamright,The Lady was very helpful. Roy,5
Roamright,"On the many times that I have used RoamRight I have no complaints with their services, and the price is very resonable.  No claims have been filed by me so far though.",5
Roamright,I was fortunate enough not to have to use my insurance policy but it always gives me great peace of mind to know that I have it.,5
Roamright,"Unfortunately I had to cancel a vacation due to issues at work.  The process to file a claim was seamless from start to finish. No issues at all, would definitely recommend.",5
Roamright,A seamless set up and we did not have to use it.  Expensive because we went to Iran. Will always use them as we have done on the past.,5
Roamright,Where thorough in getting all the information that was needed to finalize the claim.  Kept me updated on the progress,5
Roamright,"Super fast, very easy— thank you!",5
Roamright,"We purchased travel insurance to the tune of 546.40. Upgraded to cancel for any reason. We experienced a trip delay - due to a tropical storm- flight cancelled and we did not arrive to our destination until a day later.  We incurred some plane ticket charges due to the change and lost out on our first night of accommodations as this was not refundable.RoamRight denied our claim saying that travel insurance is generally misunderstood and benefits don't start until the RESCHEDULED departure date.  We lost out on an entire day of our trip, and had to pay for a night's stay when we were not even at the villa. This makes no sense at all!    This was why we purchased trip insurance in the first place!We have purchased trip insurance with RoamRight before, but we will not again.Very disappointed with their service- and I would not recommend them.",1
Roamright,"We are so impressed with the fast, courteous service we received from Arch Roam Right getting a full refund on a China trip scheduled Sept 3.  Bill fell down the stairs and completely tore his patella tendon on Aug 26 and had surgery Sept 4.  So for 7 weeks he was confined to a recliner in the living room and I was his caretaker. The insurance reimbursement will help pay for all the medical bills and therapy which Bill began Oct 28.",5
Roamright,"We have been happy with your charges, but fortunately never have needed to use them.",5
Roamright,"My trip went off with no problems. But right before I left, Arch sent an email detailing how to make a claim if needed. I thought this was a nice touch. Will use this company again in the future.",5
Roamright,"I backed over a tree in SE Asia with a rental car. I provided paperwork from the rental company, my travel documents and documentation of the damage charged by the rental car company.  Arch RoamRight promptly reviewed and approved my claim. Simple. Worth every penny for the travel insurance.",5
Roamright,Glad I had the travel insurance.  Was easy to do.,5
Roamright,"The amount Arch said I claimed was significantly lower than my actual claim; but then the resolution said my claim was fully covered. There was no explanation for the difference so I am having to follow up. Also, the request for documentation seemed to be a bit excessive.",2
Roamright,"Easy to sign up, easy to pay. Gave me peace of mind.",4
Roamright,I did not need to use the insurance but I always purchase it.  I feel like between that and my Chase Sapphire card I have a reasonable amount of coverage. Because I often travel alone the combo makes me feel much more covered in case of emergency.,5
Roamright,Thank you for your quick review of my claim for the cancelled trip. It's very much appreciated.,5
Roamright,"From start to finish, the claim process was easy and quick.  It took less than 3 weeks from submission to closure.  A few years ago, I had a claim with a different company which took about 4 months to resolve so the timeline for this claim was impressive!",5
Roamright,No review text found,5
Roamright,The insurance with RoamRight gave us peace of mind in our travels,5
Roamright,"RoamRight was slow to respond, asked repeatedly for the same info & probably would not have paid our legitimate claim, had our travel agent not gotten involved.  She sends business RoamRight's way & finally, after 2 months, they paid up.  Like I said, w/o our travel agent's intervention, I do not believe RoamRight would have paid us.I strongly urge anyone buying travel insurance to steer clear of RoamRight.",2
Roamright,"In October of 2019 I purchased a travel policy with the intention of having coverage mainly for the medical coverage. Thankful I didn’t need to to file a claim for medical purposes, however my jacket was missing from a coat hook in a restaurant.  It was not a very expensive jacket, however I filed the claim and it was rejected because I did not have a police report.  It never occurred to me to contact the authorities in a foreign county for a missing wind breaker. My claim was denied.  The claims department stated a police report is required. Please keep this in mind.  Thankful this item was not very expensive however I’m cautious to use them again since I believe you find out how good your insurance company is when you file your claim.",1
Roamright,"I basically threw away $ on this insurance policy and likely every travel insurance policy I've ever purchased.We missed a train due to a delayed flight to Madrid. Upon our eventual arrival to the train station, we were told that the train tickets were nonrefundable and we'd have to purchase new tickets while forfeiting the old ones. We had no choice but to do that.I filed a claim upon my return. I went through all the hoops of getting the paperwork and documents needed. RoamRight denied my claim because we weren't delayed for 6 hours. Mind you, we still missed our train and the flight was still delayed, but not as long as the policy said it should be. So we wasted money on the policy and on the new tickets.I'm really disappointed in travel insurance and can't help but feel like it's a big scam. In the future I may open up a good travel credit card that provides most, if not all, the same ""protections"" this travel insurance scam supposedly does.The good reviews for insurance here appear to be mostly people saying ""five stars, didn't have to use it."" Filter your results by people who actually *did* file a claim and were denied before you make a purchase.It's my belief that very, very few circumstances would allow for a successful claim and reimbursement, and that these policies offer a false sense of security.",1
Roamright,"I had a claim and they denied it.   They didn't really bother to understand the issue, they just basically told me where to go.   I took them to Small Claims Court and the judge was incredulous.   Ultimately they had to pay me $2,800 and change.  I bought the policy from the Squaremouth website which has a zero complaint policy which turned out to be totally worthless.  I really appreciate having a judge who understood the issue and ruled against them so quickly.",1

One of our traveling companions had a medical emergency and to be removed from our cruise ship and rushed to emergency room in Spain.  RoamRight helped right away and facilitated new heart pacemaker and safe return home.  We were very pleased with the help in that very difficult situation,5

Roamright,We had to cancel our bus trip because of illness. I am not real savvy with computers and needed a lot of help via the phone. Every time I called Arch RoamRight I had a helpful and patient representative to talk me through the paperwork.,5
Roamright,Everything went well...did not have use the insurance so that was a good thing.  It was easy to get signed up.,5
Roamright,"My husband ended up in the hospital 5 days prior to our trip so we had to cancel. Our travel agent was wonderful as she handled most of the cancelations. We had to fill out claim forms for Arch Insurance Solutions, provide doctors' certification and proof of payment. We did all that and for 2 weeks afterward we got an email requesting the same information again every Friday. The second one said ""second request"" and the next said ""third request"" like we had provided no information at all. I think is was an automatic email but it was very confusing. In the end with the help of our travel agent we received our money.",3
Roamright,It was easy to submit documentation. Communication was quick and professional.  We were regularly updated about our claim.,5
Roamright,"We were very pleased with the ease of signing up insurance for our trip.   A customer representative helped us to choose the right option to meet our needs from the trip itself to health coverage.   We did have a claim and again, the assistance we received was wonderful.  Whenever we called to ask a question all the representative was welcoming taking as much time as we needed to answer all our questions.  We walked away feeling everyone sincerely wanted to help make any process easy.  Thankyou for all your help.",5
Roamright,"I used Arch for my most recent trip to Morocco and Spain. I had no circumstances where I needed to use them. But I do have a friend that used them for her trip to Italy. I had recommended Arch to her, in fact. She had a fall her second day and fractured her kneecap in 3 places. The trip planned was an active one with hiking involved. She would not be able to participate and had to fly home. Arch was not paying for anything and after a lot of back and forth, agreed to pay for the cost of the actual trip, but not the flight (the flight was more costly than the trip itself).  They blamed the fall on preexisting osteopenia. (Then why buy it to begin with?). I was very surprised and will not be using them again.",1

Roamright,I have been using this travel insurance for years and I even encourage my entire family to use it. I had an incident were my baggage got lost and when found and delivered to my home it was damaged. I filed for a claim for the damaged and I got a check back. All family are using this insurance. Affordable and claims department are very helpful.,5
Roamright,"Luckily I have never had to use my policy, but RoamRight gives me all of the options I need for the best coverage.  Because of our situation the choice to cancel our trip for any reason is most important and Roam Right gives us that ability.",5
Roamright,Arch RoamRight was helpful and supportive during a very difficult time. We had to cancel a much anticipated trip because of a death in our family. The agents guided us through the claims filing process and quickly identified missing documents. Adjudication was methodical but timely. We appreciate having Arch RoamRight as our valued travel insurer,5
Roamright,"We didn't use our travel insurance, during our last trip to Europe.However we have to say that all the process of buying the insurance,documentation, letters of insurance proof, ID cards, etc. was very smooth and easy. This include the App with alerts and all kind of information.Thank you Roam Right",4
Roamright,"I did not need to ise the insurance,  but it seemed straight forward ti me . Will use again",5
Roamright,"Fortunately I did not need to use the insurance I bought for my trip, but it was nice to know that it was there, if needed.Price of insurance was very reasonable and customer service agents were great to deal with.  I will use Arch RoamRight for my next trip!",5
Roamright,"could have been a bit more timely, but I understand these things dotake time and careful consideration. thanks again.",5
Roamright,I have not received the refund yet so how can you possibly ask for a review of the services,3
Roamright,Thankfully we did not have to use the insurance.,5
Roamright,I've always used RoamRight.  Affordable and a great Peace of Mind.,4
Roamright,"Did not cover our trip interruption, our cruise in the Carribean was cut short due to Hurricane Dorian.  Initially on the phone conversation with Evelyn, she made sure  they will cover it. Then on the final decision they said they Denied our claim. What a disaster. Will not again go back and will complain to DEPT of Banking and insurance about this experience. Kim apologize for the wrong info given over the phone!! You should be ashamed of your services giving all the wrong information.",1
Roamright,This time we had no claims so nothing to report.Last fall we had to cancel an overseas trip the day we were flying out.  We filled in all the paperwork taking care to include all detail and documentation.At first they gave us a longer time frame than sounded reasonable to receive our claim but then after I called we received the full amount of our claim promptly.,5
Roamright,"We are very comfortable knowing we are insured all year, for the last three years.  Unfortunately we did have to use the trip cancellation after my husband suffered a stroke before a cruise.  It was a very simple process to get reimbursed, and fast.  We haven’t needed the medical portion, but having it be active at 100 miles from home, we love the peace of mind.  The price for two of us is very reasonable and I don’t think it’s gone up.",5
Roamright,I used roam right again because i had a very good experience with claim handling with my previous trip.,5
Roamright,This car rental policy gave us peace of mind on our trip to the mid West.,5
Roamright,The low raiting is due to the fact that we filed for airfare refund due to Hurricane Dorian affecting our return flights from Dominican Republic through Fort Lauderdale and we have not heard or received anything yet 15 days after our return.,1

Roamright,"We have dealt with RoamRight several times and the representatives have been very efficient. Fortunately, we've never had to use the healthcare or emergency features, but RoamRight reimbursed the deductible after our insurance company covered a theft we incurred while traveling.",5
Roamright,Very helpful and fair.,5
Roamright,"Never had a claim so I do not have any claims experience; however, I was disappointed that after age 75 we could no longer purchase the 12-month policy to cover my husband and so we had to find a new carrier.  The individual policies for each trip are astronomically expensive--somewhere around 20% of the cost the trip.",4
Roamright,"My only interaction with Arch RoamRight was buying a policy for medical evacuation for a hiking trip. The representative was informative, efficient, and friendly.  I was a satisfied customer - and happily, I didn't need to make a claim.",4
Roamright,"As a traveler to many exotic locations, though I have never had a need to make an insurance claim, I believe this RoamRight insurance policy to be good protection at a reasonable cost.",4
Roamright,I used Arch RoamRight's easy to access online service to submit my claim and support documentation. I got confirmation of receipt - very reassuring. I was kept advised of the steps in their internal process and was asked a couple of questions - my claim was complicated. I then received confirmation that my full claim had been approved and a few days later received a check in the mail. This was the first time I've ever made a travel insurance claim and I'm very happy with how the process was managed. I highly recommend using Arch RoamRight for travel insurance - life happens to all of us.,5
Roamright,I was satisfied with the communication on my claim. I still have not received the confirmation on the refund for my one daughter? But I have for the other 4 of us. So I assume it was processed the same. But otherwise very good process and I liked the e-mails telling me where things were as you were reviewing everything. Kept me from wondering if things were being looked at.,4
Roamright,I have NOT recieved my money refund..u keep asking for more info every 4 weeks ago this pushing my claim back another 5 to 6 weeks.!!!!!!  I AM FURIOUS!!!!!!!  As far as I can tell you are running a scam operation..I am planning to get an attorney .  I will NEVER BUY OR RECCOMEND ANYONE ELSE TO DO SO !!!!!.,1
Roamright,In my opinion it longer than I expected for the claim to be processed and paid.,4
Roamright,"We had to cancel due to injury. It literally took about 2 months for arch to cooperate and make a decision if they were going to cover the claim. The amount of paperwork, emailing, paperwork from the doctor, and recovering documentation was overwhelming and ridiculous. It almost wasn’t worth it. I’m glad that I only partially paid so I was only waiting on a smaller reimbursement rather than the whole amount.I did submit what I thought was accurate and correct; however the response time from arch was slow and confusing. I received information from the person examining it that was different from what I found online.👎🏻 Information (contradicting at times)👎🏻 Communication (slow)👎🏻 Time frame (2 months is too long)👎🏻 Customer service (inaccurate and confusing)👎🏻 Explanation (emailed me generic responses)",2
Roamright,My biggest concern was cost. I also liked that I could take what I wanted.Did not have to use but I was happy to know I had it if I needed it.This was my second time using Roam right Ins.My traveling companions also used Roam Right. I'm in the process of looking for my next adventure now .I will look at RoamRight when the time is right.,5

Roamright,"We have had a RoamRight policy for 3 years...fortunately we have not had to use it but I am happy with their presentation, quick response for questions and how everything is spelled out.",5
Roamright,"Reprehensible. That would be word that I would use to describe Roamright insurance company. They forced us to provide four different sources for our claim. Our claim was legal and legitimate, our plane flight was cancelled due to insufficient staffing. We had to get tickets with another airline so I could get home for work. We only wanted a claim for the difference in the price of the airline tickets; fair, right?! Not according to Roamright!!! Don't do business with this company, I know we never will. I have already posted on social media, so tell your friends so that won't get stuck like we were.",1
Roamright,"The best investment I ever made was buying the annual travel insurance plan.  Of course, no one wants to use it, but after I broke my ankle in Guinea, and needed to be transported safely and quickly home to Kentucky for surgery, Roam Right came through.  I had to cancel  the safari I had planned, but again, the insurance helped ease the loss with reimbursement of most of the cost of the tour.",5
Roamright,"The representatives with whom I interacted were well trained, professional, and helpful. Although I was asked for additional information on several occasions, we finally reached the bottom line to work out the final payment due to me. Roam Right is an excellent travel insurance company for the frequent traveler. I feel protected. Thank you.",5
Roamright,"This review took longer than any insurance review I have ever experienced.  Roamright kept requesting additional information from me, only to deny me coverage for something that they should have informed me of straight away.  I had to go back to two different airlines, credit card statements etc and they denied my claim when they had no intention of paying it. Never again.",2

Roamright,"I had to cancel our trip to Europe due to a medical emergency. The Arch agent who was assigned to my claim was efficient, courteous  and accepted all my documents via email. A decision was made in a timely manner. I was pleased with their evaluation and I would definitely use Arch again for future travel plans.",5
Roamright,Easy to process claim.  Fair settlement,5
Roamright,"I have used your insurance a couple times and have been satisfied.  Prompt quotes, ease of ordering, and proper follow up makes a desirable package.  I believe the cost to be a bit excessive, since I am retired and on fixed income.  However, at age 71, it is a necessity.",4
Roamright,"Lost luggage at international flight's point of entry, results in our missing two flights.  Incurred hotel expenses and rental car.  Over $600 in losses and incurred costs.  Three claims submitted and after five months, three denials.  What a waste of time.",1

Roamright,"I bought my travel insurance by calling the customer service. The representative was very friendly and helpful. After I explained my trip, she suggested the insurance I should buy and explained the benefits and restrictions clearly. My trip went smoothly without problems. I would use the company again for my next trip.",5
Roamright,My experience was wonderful. I’ll recommend your services to family and friends.,5
Roamright,Operator was thorough and helpful.  She took care of all our questions to our satisfaction.  We signed up for an annual plan as we have several trips planned Ozner the next 12 months.,5
Roamright,I think it was great just think the process took a little long  and I feel I did most of the research!,4

Roamright,"The insurance representative was very helpful. He explained things clearly and completely. He was very personable. Thank goodness no problems occurred, so I did not make any claims, but I will certainly use your company again when I travel.",5
Roamright,The only time I claimed they were fast and accurate.,5

Roamright,Roam right was very quick and responsive. Someone had hit the rental car we were in and didn’t leave a note. Roam right had claim closed and paid within 3 weeks. Fabulous service!!  We will always purchase travel/rental car insurance through them. It was primary too.,5
Roamright,"I called several times to inquire, clarify and ask but status. Each time I was treated with respect and each time I felt Deandra wad really listening to me and thoroughly addressing my issue.Thank you for your responsive and thorough review of my claims.",5

Roamright,"Thank you so much for all the help we were given in Europe during our trip after an injury occurred.  Your company was prompt in answering our questions and we were treated with professionalism and compassion. Coming home was the best solution to our problem and you made that happen. Since we've been home all the contact we've had with your company has been positive.Many, many thanks.",5
Roamright,Once I filed my claim it was processed within weeks.  Only one e-mail from an agent asking for more information.  Once I sent that to him my claim was processed in fast and timely manner.,5
Roamright,"Although we did not have to use it, it was still the best value.",4
Roamright,"The travel insurance I purchased for lost luggage was of no use. It took several days for the airline to determine where the luggage was located. By the time they located it, we were on safari in the Serengeti National Park with no possibility of purchasing missing essential items. Just be aware that having travel insurance might not solve any problems.",3
Roamright,"All’s well that ends well, but initially when I reported a fall, There was confusion, back and forth discussions  over whether it would be covered by Roam Right or my insurance, Medicare, as I was in Israel. However everything did work out and it was covered and I receive the attention/healthcare I needed. This was the first time I have ever had to report anything and am pleased.",4

Roamright,"Our first experience with RoamRight (AKA Tin Leg or Arch Insurance) was excellent. Purchasing travel insurance for a group of 20 family members was daunting, but RoamRight made it easy and answered all of our questions promptly along the way. Unfortunately we had to file a claim, but RoamRight made that easy as well. We are totally satisfied and recommend them to anyone in need of travel insurance.",5
Roamright,"I didn't need  the service while traveling, thankfully, so I really can't give a review.",4
Roamright,"I've used this insurance before, and although a bit of a hassle to collect benefits, they did eventually pay out. They required a ton of documentation before a long, delayed payment occurred. However, coverage was provided as purchased. I recently make another purchase, and had difficulty creating a log-in registration, hence my less than perfect rating.",4
Roamright,"We didn’t have an medical emergency, which is a blessing. But we have been using roam right for the last 5 years for our mission team members. We have had no issues applying, everyone I’ve ever talked to has been helpful and it’s a quick simple process.",5

Roamright,Very pleased.  The forms were fairly easy to fill out and hassle was kept at a minimum.,5
Roamright,"Review (4 stars) is based on ease of signup & affordability.   Haven't had to actually file a claim & ""use"" the insurance and/or experience the customer service.   That would be the real test, wouldn't it?",4
Roamright,"Was quick with a response, after losing her husband was very satisfied with the outcome.",5
Roamright,"I purchased an Arch RoamRight Elite policy so I would have superior coverage, or so I thought, for a trip to Cambodia and back. Only one thing happened that I wanted to file an insurance claim for: a laundry service ruined (ripped) a nice $50 LL Bean Tropicwear shirt. I tried to get a note or something from the laundry guy but he could not read or write in his own language. I used Google translate and as best I could tell, it got caught in a machine. I was told on the phone with Arch that it ""should not be a problem"" covering the shirt. Then, weeks later, the adjuster denied the claim because of no documentation from the laundry man. I appealed. The appeal was denied. Arch said I should have contacted the police. This is a very bad idea due to corruption. For the police to help me, I would have had to pay them. That is the best-case scenario with the police. Or, I could have been arrested for harassing a local, or disorderly conduct. In either case, I am in hot water with police and a judge and would have had to buy my way out of that. Either Arch is completely ignorant about Cambodia, or this was just an excuse to deny my claim.I am very disappointed with the Arch Insurance Company. I will never use Arch again and I would obviously never recommend it to anyone.",1
Roamright,The claim was processed and paid per the contract.,5
Roamright,Three weeks before our scheduled trip to Europe my father was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer.   He was given less than a month to live and we did not want to leave his side.   I contacted RoamRight and received assistance is filing a claim.  I was nervous since he was still with us and we did not known how long he would survive but we did not want to risk being out of the country.   RoamRight paid our claim in full.   I highly recommend their services.,5
Roamright,"My claim was processed as Trip Delay and Trip Interruption. The last day (actually hours) of my trip to Greece, my passport was either lost or stolen, I don't know which but I had to stay and go the US Embassy to obtain another passport.  I was disappointed to learn that my return airfare home was not a covered incident under my policy.  What is the purpose of TRAVEL insurance if it doesn't cover mode of transportation, just saying.  Thankful my hotel and taxi was covered.",3
Roamright,"Easy submission, fast processing and payment.  We were very happy with the services provided provided during our claim.",5
Roamright,"We submitted a claim for expenses incurred due to a long delay/rerouting caused by tornados around DFW. Arch Rome Right compensation forms were easy to complete and our claim was paid in full in a reasonable time. Based on this experience, plan to use this company in the future and would recommend Arch to friends without any reservations.",5
Roamright,"Easy to follow where the statusof our claim with the email showing what was still needed regarding info. from us.If course we were happy to have the full refund that we hoped for.   I didn’t know if there was a cutoff date for info.  Thank you, Abigail, for your quick responses.",5
Roamright,Keep asking for things that I had already mailed in each time I spoke to someone they couldn’t find things that I had sent in,3
Roamright,Incredibly satisfied! The process was SO SIMPLE. All of it was done online and they made it so easy. Barely any back-and-forth. All of the documentation I needed was easily accessible and nothing crazy like birth certificate (if you know what I mean!)I got emails every time it moved to a new step in the process so I was never left wondering and the whole thing was done in less than a week. I got an email day-off confirming that the process was complete saying that a check would be cut the following week on 6/14/19.,5
Roamright,Customer service is great.  Filing the claims online was very easy and straight forward.  Claims were processed fairly quick once the documents were uploaded. Overall a pleasant experience.,4
Roamright,"I want to thank the company for their quick response to my concern. After arriving in Morocco in April I found one of the wheels to my luggage was  cracked.  For the following ten days, while on vacation, it was difficult to navigate the luggage from hotel to hotel due to the broken wheel.  When I returned home I filed a report with Arch RoamRight and was pleased to receive a check in a timely manner to pay for the repair of the broken wheel.  I also was pleased with their customer service. When I called their office with a question they were very helpful.Thank you!",5
Roamright,I ultimately got the refund that was deserved. It took a few phone calls but everybody was nice and professional.,4
Roamright,We had to make a hard decision to cancel a planned trip and we were pleased that Arch RoamRight was able to refund our deposit and related expenses. It was an easy process with no hassles!,5
Roamright,"While RoamRight eventually paid the claim and once they decided to pay, the check came quickly, the process was not smooth and we had to involve the Customer Advocacy assistant through Insuremytrip. Contacting them while on the trip yielded no help and we had to schedule our own flights back. They initially denied my claim, but did not state that til 5 weeks after sending all documentation.  They then initially denied another part of the claim two more times.  Through the whole process, they NEVER once called me, if I called them they gave a blanket statement, and if you clicked on contact about your claim and sent an email- they NEVER once responded to it.  It took almost 4 months to resolve a simple claim of an injury while traveling that required returning to the United States for surgery on a minor child.  I have used trip insurance many times- fortunately have not had to submit claims often- but the other time I have it was a MUCH more easier process and they were very receptive.",2
Roamright,"Arch RoamRight made filing a claim easy. The processing time was short and efficient. I was notified each step along the way. Truly appreciate their service. Thanks to Monica, our claims representative",5
Roamright,They paid.  I have deducted one star becaue I had to call to find out the status of my claim,4
Roamright,Everything was handled quickly with no stress involved thanks to Yvonne.,5
Roamright,"Resolution to my claims were extensively long, in my opinion. All necessary documents were provided within a week of initial contact. Supplementary documentation to support the claim was not requested until nearly 8 weeks later at which time the claim was resolved. Continued contact with the person filing the claim was absent - I had to make the contact in order to get answers to the reason for delays.",3
Roamright,We had several questions concerning forms and documentation which were answered with clarity and professionalism.,5
Roamright,Dear RoamRight: Thank you for sending the findings of the review. I do look forward to receiving check payment. I find that communication between Reviewer and Insured were drastically lacking professionalism in contact. I placed several calls to RoamRight regarding the status of my claim. The responses from the Reps included: Has been referred to a Reviewer; Reviewer will get back to you within a few days (these are just a few of the responses). The last phone call resulted in the Rep sending an e-mail to Reviewer and copy to Supervisor. This yielded prompt results. It would have been nice to hear from the Reviewer  regarding the status. It is not my nature to be negative. Please regard this comment as a possible improvement to your process. Thank you.,3
Roamright,"Although I have not had to make a claim, the prices and coverage are very fair- much more economical than most travel or airline site offers.  I called the information line to ask a few detailed questions about coverage and was very satisfied with the interaction and response.  I have purchased 3 policies and will do so again for future travel.  Thank you!",5
Roamright,"Excellent time response to claim, followup was good but a more detailed report  on how the result was made would have been nice.",5
Roamright,"They did a great job on all levels including health, travel and trip reimburse. It was tough enough having to go to the hospital for 5 days suddenly in Hawaii when on vacation. They made the whole nightmare pass quickly with no hassles. I highly recommend them and we will never travel without this trip insurance.",5
Roamright,Filing a claim required a lot of documentation but results were well worth the time spent.  Thankful we had travel insurance to cover unforeseen events that occurred during our trip to Italy.,5
Roamright,It was so easy to upload documents to the website and my refund was granted quickly. I could not be more happy with this professional trip insurance company. Worth every penny.,5
Roamright,"We have been using RoamRight for a while now, and never had a claim.  Well, this year we had a plane cancelled on us at 5am the day we were to leave. We jumped in the car and drove 170 miles to catch a connecting flight. We made it (barely) and saved the trip. When we called RR to see if we were eligible for any reimbursement they had us send in many claim forms, cancelled checks etc. After over a month of this, and sending all they wanted,they advised us we were not eligible for anything. We had asked for $18 for gas spent getting to our connecting flight. They wanted a gas receipt!  What I would like to know is why they couldn't tell us before having us jump through all these hoops. Will never use this company again.",1

Roamright,"My family cruises a lot and we found Arch RoamRight to be the Right overage for us.  We purchase their insurance for primarily two reasons: First, the medical coverage - we travel to many foreign countries and second, repatriation - God forbid that something happens to one of us.  RoamRight provides that piece of mind that we are covered during, potentially, the most devastating and costly events that may happen when vacationing.This additional coverage is quite cost competitive for us and having a minor get coverage for free with a paying adult is a great bonus.I have purchased this for vacation travel over 25 times and luckily had just one claim for baggage.  The claim process was quick and easy and settled within a week.I highly recommend Arch RoamRight as they are Right for us!",5
Roamright,everything was done via mail/email.  never talked to real person but things went very smoothly. i have had annual policies with this company for many years but first claim. i would highly recommend,5
Roamright,The coverage for what you pay is the best of any plans.,5
Roamright,Very polite and professional. Wondered why you needed a credit card statement since I provided a hotel receipt with my name and credit card number on it. Seems excessively nosy.I received the request for a review before I received my payment. One suggestion I have for improvement is to tell me the method of payment.  I was looking for an electronic payment or credit to my credit card and did not know it would be sent surface mail. I held off on reviewing until the check was received and deposited.,4
Roamright,"did not need to use the policy, but knowing we were covered was well worth the very reasonable cost of the policy",5
Roamright,Excellent.  If you need travel insurance RoamRight is the way to go.,5
Roamright,"Filed a claim online after returning from a Cruise. Submitted documents, and within 72 hours RoamRight issued a check. No hassles. They have become our prime travel insurance provider.",5

Because these gentlemen are so helpful and thorough I have no doubt everything will proceed smoothly.  I hope their supervisors see this post.",5
Roamright,Had to cancel our trip due to illness. No hassle full prompt refund!,5
Roamright,I mean I paid you $75 and never had to use it but when I used you before on my last trip you got everything sorted out pretty quick only reason we came back to you,5
Roamright,I had to cancel a trip once due to illness and Roam Right payed me off in full within a few weeks.  I will continue using them as they are cheaper and more inclusive than purchasing insurance from the cruise lines.,5
Roamright,"I hoped to never use the insurance, but I became ill in Kazakstan and came home a day early per my doctor's order.  I followed the instructions on how to make a claim because I had to pay $1950  to change my airline plans with Turkish Airlines, and lost a hotel room night I had paid in advance.  I had copies of the bills, etc.  A month later I got an email stating that a check was being processed for me.  I received a check for $1950 to cover my expenses!   I was surprised and delighted !!",5
Roamright,Karla was amazing! She helped me everything. This is the third trip for us and we always use RoamRight.,5
Roamright,I never had to use the service. My one complaint is that I never received a renewal notice. I would think that would just be good business.,4
Roamright,"I enjoyed my travels with Stunning tour company. Everything went as planned. Tour guide, Elsie, did an admirable job of managing the 33 participants on the tour. The people on my tour were friendly and happy. This demeanor lasted throughout the tour.",5
Roamright,I have used RoamRight a couple of times and when I’ve needed them they were there- timely and efficiently,5
Roamright,"I repeatedly choose RoamRight because they have the best rates for comparable coverage.  It's great piece of mind when booking an expensive vacation well in advance; although, I am grateful we've not needed to activate their services!",5
Roamright,"I have had the annual policy for four years.  My last policy expired Feb 24, 2019.  I was going to renew, but my son had a serious accident on Feb 20, 2019.  I had a cruise scheduled for March 16, 2019 that I had to cancel.  I was told over the phone that I could get reimbursed because the accident happened before the policy expired and I had paid the amount of the cruise within the policy dates.  My claim was denied -I was told the cruise was not during the policy period.  I went to the trouble of obtaining a police report and other documents because I was told I would be reimbursed. This was very disappointing to me.  I always had good service before from RoamRight so I decided to again purchase a policy.",4
Roamright,"I had a medical issue. Overall, it was good. I was asked for a lot of data that I did not have with me. This caused a delay in getting the provider paid. I would suggest that you offer the option to work directly with the provider. This would improve for all concerned parties.",4
Roamright,"quick and easy, forms were easy to fill out and they walk through the steps",5
Roamright,I have compared coverages and Roam Right wins all the time.,4
Roamright,"We had completed our first year policy with no claims.  So, have no review for that end of the process.  However, our policy had expired a couple of weeks prior, and it wasn't until I remembered to check the date that I called in and did another one year policy.  I believe the person I spoke with told me that they are now notifying the client prior to expiration for renewal.  I think for the choice of benefit and the cost, this is a very good plan.  The true test is how responsive the company is regarding a claim.  I like having the coverage and hopefully don't ever have to file a claim.",4
Roamright,"Terrible company.  I had a terrible experience dealing with Arch/Roamright this go-around.  I needed to file a claim because I was hassled at the mexican boarder during my mexican trip which caused me to miss my flight and subsequently my hotel and return flight.  I had ""Trip Cancellation/Trip Delay"" coverage, but roamright denied my claim because that is not a covered reason.  Can you imagine your car insurance denying a claim ""oh i'm sorry we only cover damage to the left side of you vehicle!""  Utterly ridiculous!  No one ever wants to HAVE to make an insurance claim, but you certainly want to be assured that you will be covered if you DID have to!  I will NOT do business with them again.",1
Roamright,"We were quite impressed by how responsive RoamRight was in paying benefits on a recent claim due to a medical emergency while traveling.  In contrast to RoamRight, we had one other past experience with a different insurance carrier and they did everything they could to avoid paying benefits on a legitimate claim.  It took 4 months before they finally came through.  Not so with RoamRight.  They seem to have integrity and paid both our trip interruption costs and medical expenses on a timely basis.  The claims process couldn't have been easier.  We hope we won't ever need the trip interruption and medical emergency benefits again but having the insurance provides some peace of mind for our travels.  We expect to be consistently loyal customers.  One other great thing about RoamRight:  They offer an annual multi-trip policy which covers you for all travel within the year.  If you travel more than a couple of times a year, it is definitely worth considering.  We couldn't be more satisfied with this company!",5
Roamright,"It Is Unfortunate There Is Not A (0) Star Rating! Terrible experience ! It all started with it took a month and some weeks to get the claim even started to process. I had to resort to calling which I did several times and spoke to Karla who told me several times after looking up my claim that all my information I provided was good and my claims adjuster should have processed it already. (several times ) she said she left messages to claims adjuster. I asked to speak to her. She was never in. I had to keep calling back because I never received a call back. This was super inconvenient because I am working throughout my day and had to set reminders to call again to roamright. Very Stressful to say the least. Finally I was put through to Belinda who was very rude to make the situation even more uncomfortable. Just Terrible Experience!!!! So bad I will be reporting to BBB. Unfortunate. Thumbs down. Had I known this prior I would have shopped around for a better travel insurance. Definately Think Twice Before Choosing Roam Right insurance.*In Regards to your response Roamright, Once again I am shocked that you are deliberately lying online to say Belinda was not rude. She was awkwardly rude & due to the circumstances that it took So long to process and had not even been started. Your front desk person Karla who was very nice several times looked over everything and Ensured me that I had Everything needed to process and was not sure why it had not been started, as she reached out to ""Belinda and was never in or returned Any calls. I had to persistently make efforts and calls (Super Inconvenient) to make sure it got started. Belinda was very rude on top of the already uncomfortableness of the situation. Its Just Terrible and Shocking Customer Service!  Be Aware with Roamright is all I can say so this does Not happen to other People.",1
Roamright,good news roam right,5
Roamright,"Excellent guide, well organized, excellent places to stay. Best experience ever.",5
Roamright,"My trip had to be canx when I broke my ankle which required surgery. Recovery will take months (non walking, walking)  The plane tickets were 'non refundable' and so we could not get that money back.  Arch Roam Right insurance helped get some of the cost of the plane tickets  We had already received the refund from the tour company.  Thank you for helping to take the disappointment of not being able to travel.",5
Roamright,"We had planned a trip to China but had to cancel due to a leg injury. We submitted the required paperwork and Arch paid us in full with no hassles. We were so impressed we took out Arch insurance again on a rip to Italy last year and a recent trip to Greece. Thankfully, we didn't have to use it but we felt good about being covered by them. Their customer service is great, always ready to answer questions. We have since recommended them to our daughter who is planning a trip to Punta Cuna and another friend who is going on a European river cruise. Arch will be the insurance we will always use on future trips. Very happy with it.",5
Roamright,Easy to purchase coverage. Quote was quick. Receipt was emailed quickly.,5
Roamright,"Quick, Easy, and Inexpensive!  Thankfully did not have to use it while out or the country.  I printed and read the policy and covers many situations that could happen that my regular health insurance would not cover while I am outside the USA.  Will definitely purchase it again.",5
Roamright,"I bought multiple policis to get the coverage I wanted. I probably overpaid. Fortunately, the trip went fine and we did not need to use the insurance.",3
Roamright,"I would like to say that I was very pleased to have purchased RoamRight Essential for our trip to South Africa.  Unfortunately our trip was cancelled due to illness but the best part was the good service we received from RoamRight.  When I didn't know how to start the claim or how to get the documents to RoamRight, I called and all my questions were answered. The claim process was easy for a first time travel claim.  I will recommend them and plan to use them again for our next trip.Thank you,",5
Roamright,"There really wasn't any experience.  I went to the website, compared what was offered with other travel insurance company's, decided the price was right for the desired coverage and paid the bill.  End of story.",5
Roamright,I cannot say enough good things about this company.  My husband had a heart attack on one of our cruises and they were there for me every step of the way.  I didn't want to stay in Nassau (where we were sent due to bad weather in the states) and they sent the next available air lift for us.  They sent a nurse to pick us up on discharge and was with us until we arrived home and my house was comfortable sitting in his recliner.,5
Roamright,I recently had to cancel a cruise due to losing my job. My claim was handled very quickly. I recommend RoamRight for travel insurance 100%.,5
Roamright,Our first time to purchase travel insurance and unfortunately we had to utilize the policy to its full extent.  RoamRight was easy to work with and paid the claim quickly.  I have purchased a policy for each trip since this occurrence and travel with peace of mind knowing I have RoamRight for any emergency that may arise.,5
Roamright,"The service of this company does not deserve even one star.When the company wants money while selling their policy, its two easy step. But when it comes to their customers to get the reimbursement of the claim, they cause so much inconvenience to their customers by not responding to the customers queries regarding their claims.I won't recommend to buy rental car insurance from this company.",1
Roamright,I do a lot of traveling out of the country. I’ve taken out an annual policy for the past 2 years and which was very affordable. I’ve also had a travel issue during both policy years. The service provided me from RoamRight was quick and top notch. I will use them again this year.,5
Roamright,All good with service and representative who took care of us.,5
Roamright,"This review is long overdue...My experience was a good as it could be given I had to cancel my vacation due a serious illness. The guidelines and assistance provided made submitting my claim relatively easy and the turn around time was fantastic (I had a check in less than 2 weeks from submission). I had read a few negative reviews and all I can think of is they didn’t have proper documentation and were angry when the company wouldn’t just take their word for it. I hope to “pay back” the Roam Right with future insurance purchases on vacations that go without a hitch. I have recommended the service multiple times to co-workers, friends and family since.",5
Roamright,They made the process of filing a claim nice and simple. I was worried my claim wouldn't be approved but they did approve it indeed. This is the first company i used for travel insurance and the only one i can vouch for. You cannot take a policy while you are already abroad though which is why I didn't purchase another policy.,5
Roamright,"Seems like a great deal, but don't fall for it! I purchased the extra ""cancel for any reason policy"" as I was taking a trip to met my husband, but he is active duty navy and so occasionally he is called elsewhere and his leave is revoked. I've used USAA in the past for trip insurance for this type of thing, but because we were traveling separately and meeting up I thought a cancel for any reason policy would be easier. WRONG. His deployment ended up changing and so I canceled 7 days before my trip. I submitted all paperwork on October 10th, 2018. After multiple emails and calls finally Shannon Bowers got back to me (in November!), asking for more paperwork while listing numbers that didnt match what I had sent! I immediately responded and never heard from her again....since then (now December 19th) I have called EIGHT times, and each time it is a new excuse. 2 weeks ago they guaranteed it would be done by last week. Last Friday they guaranteed me this week. On Monday they said by 5 pm, and yesterday they said they need another few days! Today I called and they said my ""file"" shows that a decision will be made by December 21st. Enough! They just are giving me the run around to avoid paying. What an awful company. The whole point of purchasing a cancel for ANY reason policy is to avoid all of this and feel comfortable knowing that you will be reimbursed! I will be submitting legal complaints to get this taken care of if I do not get an answer by December 21st. I wish I never fell for their lies in the first place. I truly hope everyone avoids this company in the future!Edit: after this review, roam right finally contacted me that my claim has been processed and a check will be sent to be tomorrow. I appreciate them finally getting back to me! I am still frustrated that it took this much effort, and a few reviews to get a response but I appreciate a company that owns their mistakes and attempts to fix them. I stand by that other companies are far more efficient and worth the money, and I hope that Roam Right gets it together in the future. No one should have to go through so much effort to get something they paid for.",3
Roamright,The cost of the travel insurance is reasonable. The insurance benefits are very comprehensive. No claims have been submitted since there has been no need to file a claim.  It is a bit difficult to provide an objective review of RoamRight since no claims have been submitted.,5
Roamright,"First, I called the company and talked with a very informative lady by the name of Danielle.  She made suggestions and answered all my questions which prompted me to decide to purchase Arch RoamRight.  Because the office was closed over the holidays, I bought a policy online, but it was necessary to make a couple of changes manually. She told me the best time to call, and when I did, she could not have been more cheerful or happy to help me. In these days of troublesome customer service, I can't say enough positives about my pleasurable experience and Danielle's work ethic.",5
Roamright,"I have used RoamRight for years and always get great service. Today I once again received courteous, cheerful help while enrolling for insurance.  Strong work.",5
Roamright,"I compared a few different insurance companys and found this one to be very reasonable. I also had an issue where my policy wasn't emailed to me due to an error on my part. I emailed a representative and they were able to send all the information I needed and in a timely fashion. Excellent service, Thank you.",5
Roamright,The customer service is amazing! I had many questions but Danielle was patient and knowledgeable. I was comforted by her expertise.,5
Roamright,"Bad faithThis insurance company is non responive to claim request and ignores corespondence and requests for service.The selling agent Squaremouth, also is non responsive once they have your policy payment.My next step is to file a legal complaint in my local jurisdiction. I have been counseled to name both firms as defendants. My advice to readers of this review is stay away from both of these companies.",1
Roamright,"We went on a trip to Europe and took out travel ins with Romeright. We told them the trip was about 10,000. for 2 cruises back to back. Halfway through the trip my sister passed away causing us to cut our trip and not take the second cruise from Amsterdam. When we got back we tried to get help from RR ins. They keep asking for the same things over and over again. When I try to reach out to them we are told that wait times are an hour or more, nobody gets back to us. This whole attempt to recoup any of our expenses has been a complete joke.",1
Roamright,"We scheduled our trip more than a year ahead and purchased your insurance. Had no idea that river cruises are fairly often cancelled at the last minute due to high or low water. Our cruise was cancelled two days before we were scheduled to leave home. While the cost of the cruise itself was refunded, we had scheduled extensions on our own that were non-refundable. We managed to book another cruise for the time period, at additional cost, but had to fly to original destination and then take train to the new location. Re-booking flights was not possible, since costs for new tickets much higher.  Also had to fly to debarkation point to resume rest of trip. Reading our policy nothing seems to cover cruise line cancellations.",4
Roamright,I didn't need to use it but good to know I have travel insurance. Will definitely purchase again if and when I travel.,5
Roamright,Have used this company several times and was always satisfied with their customer service.  Never had to make a claim.  They did assist overseas in locating my lost luggage and expediting delivery. Just booked another trip and again the customer service was outstanding.,5

Roamright,"5 people from FL and OH made it on time to JFK to connect to LOT flight to Warsaw. Delta canceled 3 of us from RDU to JFK due to weather and we missed our LOT flight to WAW that evening.Roam Right reimbursed us for the first day of missed tour and tour guide, prepaid hotel, meals, and rebooking of Flt to Warsaw. LOT airlines was uncaring of our plight and charged Us to rebook by saying only business class seats were available the next day at an up charge of $5200.Roam Right paid it all. Roam Right is an honest caring company and I give them a AAAA rating. Superior.I will add that very detailed documentation is the key to a fast resolution. I sent copies of flight cancellation notices from Delta as well as tour invoices, tour acknowledgment of delay, credit card statements, boarding passes, meal receipts, etc. supporting every aspect of our dilemma.I filed my claim 20 days ago and was notified today I should get a check in 5-7 days.Ps. I DO NOT recommend LOT (Polish) Airlines. You will get no sympathy from them and they will take advantage of your misfortune.",5
Roamright,"Glad we did not need to use it, but glad we had it! Thanks.",5
Roamright,"The sign-up process was easy.  I asked for the same coverage as my brother-in-law's (same trip).  The price was right (didn't need Bob Barker nor Drew Carey, lol).  Fortunately, we did not need to use it; however, it was there for peace of mind, in case we did need it.  Would definitely use RoamRight again.",5
Roamright,Easy company to sign up with. Prices are very good. We never had to use it but bought it just in case we did. We have used them 2 years in a row. Will definitely use them again.,5
Roamright,It was easy to sign up with this company. We did so four years ago for the first time after hearing about an absolutely horrible travel experience some friends of ours had had but one in which this company came through in flying colors. This year it was easy to extend our coverage as out trip lasted longer than originally intended.,5
Roamright,Impressed.  4 stars.   Customer service was professional and helpful in renewing our policy.  Bertram (spelling?) was great to deal with.  It would have been 5 stars if RoamRight could contact you annually to see if you are interested in renewing your policy for another year.,4
Roamright,"Your representatives are always knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful.",5
Roamright,"I purchased RoamRight Travel insurance for my cruise this summer. They have great customer service and are very knowledgeable. This was my first time purchasing travel insurance and although I did not need to file a claim, I was confident RoamRight would be there if I needed them.",5
Roamright,"I have recently used Arch Roam Rite, and must say I very highly recommend this company. I had to make some changes and customer service was wonderful. Everyone was so nice and very patient with me as well as very knowledgeable. I would definitely use this company again!",5
Roamright,I was unable to take a planned trip to Nicaragua this summer due to the unrest there. I filed a claim with RoamRight over 2 months ago and sent the required documentation.  I have not received payment or even a reply to my frequent emails. I have no idea if or when they will process my claim as RoamRight will not communicate with me.,1

Roamright,"I recently had to cancel a trip to Australia due to an unexpected illness.  I provided a document from the doctor and receipts.  I received my check in the mail in 3 weeks from the date of filing the claim.   I was impressed with the timing of the claim check.You could improve on your website.  Uploaded/downloaded documents could not be reviewed from the website. A live a chat was referenced, but I could not find one.  I also called on the weekend with a question and the agent could not answer.  She instructed to me call back during normal business hours.Overall, I was very satisfied.  It was quick and easy.  I would use this company again for travel insurance.",4
Roamright,"Whatever you do, DO NOT PURCHASE TRAVEL INSURANCE FROM ROAM RIGHT -- THEY'RE THE WORST!!!  My mom and I were planning a trip to Romania and Bulgaria. Because my (now recently-passed, non-traveling) stepfather's health was fragile, we took the precaution of buying travel insurance. Sure enough, a few weeks before traveling, my stepfather had to be admitted to the hospital with respiratory problems.  When his condition took a turn for the worse, we canceled our trip -- we promptly called the airlines and emailed the land tour company. My stepfather passed away in the hospital a couple days later, and we filed the insurance claim with Roam Right shortly afterward. We submitted all the required paperwork, including proof of purchase of the various travel elements, death certificate, marriage certificate, etc. That was 3 months ago, and I'm still in limbo.I have called and emailed Roam Right numerous times since then to inquire about the status of our claim. Every time I call, Customer Service takes the message and tells me I will receive a call back from Claims shortly.  NOT A SINGLE ONE OF MY PHONE CALL HAS EVER BEEN RETURNED, or my emails replied to. They just ignore me, it's infuriating!  At this point I don't even know what the status of my claim is, all I've heard is that it's ""pending"", whatever that means.THIS COMPANY IS NOT SERIOUS, they are giving me the runaround ... it seems clear to me that they have  no desire or intention of paying my claim. I have now had to enlist the help of the broker that sold me the policy to help me get this claim resolved, as well as my bank's fraud dept. I will also be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. It's taking me an awful lot of time and effort to receive what I'm rightly due -- aren't trip cancellations the reason travel insurance exists?!?  I URGE YOU, DO NOT BUY YOUR TRAVEL INSURANCE FROM ROAM RIGHT!  It's like paying an additional $500 for your trip ... with absolutely zero benefits!!!",1
Roamright,"Make sure to choose the right plan for your travel needs and read your entire policy before buying travel insurance. If you happen to have a claim, make sure to provide all of their long list of requested detailed documents otherwise it may drag a long time. I submitted a claim for medical expenses during my trip, I had questions about some docs and contacted them via email but no one from RoamRight ever replied to any of my various emails, so I didn't know if I had provided the right documents or not. After 30 days which is IMO is too long to hear from any insurance company, but It was a relief when I finally heard from the adjuster who confirmed my claim was approved and they will be sending a check within a few days. However, when I received their check, I noticed, they deducted $50 from the actual amount due. My policy and explanation of benefits clearly state that I have $0 deductible. So I emailed them saying they made a mistake as I am still owed $50. No one replied. So a few days later, I called CS and after verification of my Claim and Policy, they agreed that I have $0 deductible and they did not understand why a $50 deductible was applied and would relate the issue to the adjuster placing a sticky note on his desk. I asked when will I get the remaining $50 due. The gentleman at CS said he does not know because my adjuster is away for an undermined time period and nobody knows when he will be back. I asked if someone else could take over my case to take care of their mistake. I was told that's impossible as they have too many claims. What if this adjuster comes back in months from now or never comes back to the company? Does this mean they deliberately kept $50 which they owe me hoping I would not have noticed it at the first place?  One would assume from any legitimate honest companies that if a mistake is made, they would apology and correct it right away by transferring my claim to another adjuster and send me the additional $50 due in a timely manner in order to keep the customer happy.  8 days have now passed since I talked to CS about this issue and still no news from RoamRight. Will I ever see the missing $50? I do not know ! What I know for sure:  if I do not hear from them in the next 7 days confirming they are sending me a new check, I will not use them again.UPDATE 2 WEEKS LATER. I DID HEAR FROM ROAMRIGHT AND RECEIVED A $50 CHECK AND CONSEQUENTLY I WILL USE ROAMRIGHT AGAIN FOR MY FUTURE TRAVELS. I GUESS MY REVIEW HELPED TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS.THANK YOU TRUSTPILOT YOUR WEBSITE IS THE BEST FOR CONSUMERS.",3
Roamright,"The best part of travel insurance is not having to use it.  Nothing untoward happened on my trip, so I can't say how the company would have treated me if I'd needed their assistance.  I did have some questions that they answered professionally, courteously, and promptly.  That's the basis of my score.",4
Roamright,"I was happy to get medical coverage by itself, at such a good rate.  We didn't have to use it so I don't have enough information to rate it higher.",4
Roamright,"RoamRight is the best.  My mom had a stroke while we were traveling in Australia and their response was quick, compassionate, and caring.  The claims were processed quickly.  The cost of the insurance was very affordable.  Thank you.",5
Roamright,I love squaremouth! They are just the best! Spoke with Bertram who did an amazing job getting us the best policy!,5
Roamright,"After several flight delays by United Airlines from Phoenix on May 18, I   finally arrived in San Francisco very late at night, only to be told the next connection to L.A. and onward to New Zealand was the next morning; (crazy routing by U.A.) customer service assured me they would load my bag onto my connecting flight; but after arriving in Auckland New Zealand (for domestic flight to Wellington) my bag was not sent..I filed a claim with the help of service rep there in Auckland.  Ultimately, it took 3 days for my bag to catch up in Wellington from San Fran.  I kept all boarding tickets, all docs relative to this delay.  It was obviously necessary to buy a few necessities like underwear slacks and a shirt total in NZ $ of about 160..airline reimbursed me $100NZ so all I asked for was the difference amounting to about $60...Even with clear docs, and small amt requested RR still denied claim; I travel 3-4 times/yr internationally but will never use them and do NOT recommend them..also, the customer service rep at RR is from another country and very difficult to understand; I was told I would get email on Tues. which never came, so I had to call again...NOPE, can't depend on this company...Janice",2
Roamright,"EDIT: So after publishing this review I did get a call from an adjuster. She started the conversation by telling me they had reviewed my claim and COULD pay for the rental car we cancelled and the 1 lost night of accommodations. Obviously that was helpful but not sufficient. We talked for quite a while and finally determined 3 things: 1) I could have cancelled my entire trip and the policy would have paid. 2) If I had booked the new car, accommodations, etc. once our plane TOOK OFF we would have had no issues and 3) I called and explained the entire issue to their cust. serv. and was told it would be covered before we left (as detailed below in my original post). She said they would pull the phone records from my initial call and review them and get back to me. A few days later I received a check for the car rental & 1 night, and a few days after that got an email stating they had decided to reverse their decision and would be paying out my entire claim. So I raised them to 2 stars, because they did pay out on my claim, but that's it--I will never use them again nor would I recommend them to others. What bothers me the most is that when the claim was denied I got NO communication from them--no email, no call. I called to check the status and was told ""the papers were mailed out"" but they couldn't tell me if the claim was approved. They had my email address. Every further communication from them has been through email.ORIGINAL POST: We were scheduled to fly into CDG and take a train out of the airport 3 hours later to our final destination in the South of France. 5 days prior to departure our train was cancelled due to strikes, leaving us stranded in Paris for a day (they allowed us to reschedule the train for the next day at no charge) I called Roamright in a panic and was assured it would be covered under ""Trip Delay"" and to just submit a claim when we got home. We lost the first day of our accommodations (no refund) and also had to cancel our rental car (no refund) and rebook. we had to get a last minute hotel room in Paris, transportation there and back. I submitted all receipts and documentation shortly after returning home and was DENIED because ""trip coverage begins the day of departure and we found out about the strike 5 days prior"". WHAT IN THE WORLD????? Leaving aside the fact that I CALLED THEM BEFORE WE EVEN LEFT AND WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE COVERED, in what way is a cancelled train not covered? Our ""delay"" didn't actually happen until after arriving in France, even though I knew about it a whopping 5 days prior. I will be appealing this, but who knows. The claims people won't even talk to me on the phone, despite the letter encouraging me to ""call them directly"" with any concerns or questions. (and p.s. I'm not a nasty person, I asked nicely to speak to the adjuster who handled our claim and was told they ""don't normally speak to the customers"")Very, VERY unhappy.",2

Roamright,"Have purchased the same Adventure plan for the last 3 years for an annual ski trip.  No bad experiences, and have never had to file a claim so can't attest to that.  Overall, this WAS very affordable and seemed to have great reviews and coverage.  But this year I went to purchase the same plan as usual, only to find out that they've done away with the ADVENTURE plan and the only comparable new plan would now be more than TWICE the price of what I was paying.  Sadly, I'll be looking for a new travel insurance company.  It's too bad, because I was happy to have a go to company.",3

Unfortunately, we are unable to approve your claim or to reimburse you for any of your claimed baggage losses.According to your claim, your bag was stolen off your person on August 14, 2017. You filed a police report online on August 15, and listed clothing, jewelry, and luggage as the items stolen, totaling approximately $3,100.00.Under the section of your policy entitled ""General Provisions"" it states:""Concealment and Misrepresentation: The entire coverage will be void, if before, during or after a loss, any material fact or circumstance relating to this insurance has been concealed or misrepresented.""-------------------------------------------We have been in contact with Amazon regarding the receipt presented to us as proof of payment for several items claimed as stolen. We have confirmed that not only is the order date and shipping address incorrect on your receipt relating to the order number given, but that items on the receipt were returned at a later date.---------------------------------------------As the documents that you submitted misrepresented the details of your claim, we consider your coverage to be void. We have referred this file to Arch Insurance Company's Special Invetigative Unit for further handling.-------------------------------------------Amazon said and verified in a letter that they never reveal confidential information to any party including Arch Insurance.

Roamright,"Fortunately, I didn’t have the opportunity to use the insurance but liked knowing i had it.",5
Roamright,Did not have to use it during this trip but my husband had his luggage delayed in our previous trip to Paris and RoamRight reimbursed him quickly for the clothing he had to buy while waiting for his luggage to be delivered 36 hours after our arrival in gai Paris (Thank you Aerlingus!),5
Roamright,"Great price for the peace of mind offered.  Fortunately, we did not haveto use our travel insurance - but would definitely re-purchase for future trips.",5
Roamright,"We had no need to use the insurance, however, it gave us a peace of mind to know we had it.",5
Roamright,"They had good customer service during business hours. Had a question about medical coverage if involve in a motorbike accident on public highways in Thailand. Since an acquaintance’s claim was denied from a different carrier, I called on weekend to check but was told call back during regular business hours. I did and was told that indeed I’d be covered!Thankfully however, I didn’t have issues during my 2 months of continuous coverage. Therefore, I can’t attest to their efficiency regarding claims resolves but will definitely use them again.I liked the frequent travellers alerts received via emails regarding the areas I was visiting. It made me feel constantly connected with them!",3
Roamright,"They only honor Eastern time even though they don’t say that anywhere. I bought my policy assuming they would waive the preexisting-condition’s clause, but they said I was too late, even though it was 10:40 p.m. my time in California where I live.",1
Roamright,"Easy to buy, good prices, almost instantaneous customer service. It’s worth the peace of mind. I’ve had 1 claim that covered my entire family, it’s was paid and RReas very helpful. Seniors remember that Medicare does not pay for foreign health care like BC/BS and othe insurers do.",5
Roamright,"Needed some help from the Customer Service who promptly replied with a phone call to my email request. I don't remember the name of the lady who helped me but I would say she was professional, knowledgeable, and extremely kind!This would be our 4th purchase of travel insurance with RoamRight and the always great experience has caused us to purchase the same for two other family members who will be traveling with us.Thanks again RoamRight!",5
Roamright,"I always buy my travel insurance from roam right , very professional .. I hope I really don’t need to use 😊",5
Roamright,Did not have to use but did before and they paid as stated,5
Roamright,"Thankfully I’ve never had to file a claim, but I do find the website easy to use, the prices fair, and the one time I had to call to change a date the rep I spoke to was friendly, knowledgeable and efficient.",5
Roamright,"I am new to RoamRight, used them about four times over past couple of months. Excellent service and easy to use. I rent cars quite often and their insurance service is much better (higher coverage up to $35,000) than the rental agencies, easier to use, with excellent customer service. You can sign up for coverage online, or call their 800 number. Successful companies have to be easy to do business with...RoamRight get's that.",5
Roamright,"Roamright customer service has been a mixed bag.  Very quick to engage and answer questions, process my renewal order.  However, processing my recent claim has been surprisingly slow, no response to my email requesting status update.",3
Roamright,Helped us to select the best options for us to start. Had a great three week trip to Australia. We had no need for medical help so did not use the insurance. It was nice to know we were covered just in case as we are two seniors in our upper 70's. We would use again on our next trip.,5
Roamright,I contacted Roam Right for travel insurance for an up coming trip and Darlene assisted me in putting my package together.  Very professional and efficient.Highly recommended.,5
Roamright,"Had great coverage, but thankfully never had to make a claim so I'm not very qualified to give a review.",3
Roamright,"I researched several companies before choosing RoamRight.  They seemed to give all the coverage and a decent cost.  Luckily, I did not have a need to use them as my trip went off without a hitch.  It was good to know that I had the insurance should I need it.",5
Roamright,pretty easy and straightforward   glad we didn't have to use it,5
Roamright,"Unfortunately, I had to cancel my travel plans due to my son getting scarlet fever. I submitted all documents for my claim on 1/4/2018. I emailed them on 1/12/18 and 1/17/18 as my claim status of ""NEW"" has not changed on my account, meaning no one has reviewed my documents. I never heard back from them. Now on 1/23/18, I have yet to hear back from them via email, or see any changes on my claim status. It seems this is a good company, as long as you don't actually need their services.",1

Roamright,"Thankfully, I didn't have to use this insurance, but the peace of mind was priceless. Speaking of price, I missed the deadline to buy this short-term international travel health insurance from the tour company (Medicare doesn't cover outside the US), so they recommended contacting RoamRight directly. I did, and it turned out to be less expensive to buy direct! Customer service was friendly and helpful. I'll definitely use them for my next international trip.",5
Roamright,Just got word that our checks are being mailed Friday. Had to cancel a trip to Barcelona because of a traveling companions health issues. Sent everything they requested and our claim settled within a month. Absolutely no hassles. Will use them exclusively for all future trips !,5
Roamright,"We received customer service that went above and beyond anything that was even near expected, while we were making multiple changes to our polices. No claims have been file, but truly excellent customer service!! Thank You RoamRight for hiring competent employees... made all the difference and will use your services again (we travel a lot).",5
Roamright,The operator was helpful and clear about the insurance.,5
Roamright,"My wife and I had a cruise planned for Dec.2017. We were going with my mother-in-law, in a different cabin, for her 85th birthday. A few days before sailing she became ill and could not go on the trip. We contacted ROAMRIGHT 2 days before the trip and advised them of our situation. We filled out the required paperwork and within one month we received all of the cruise money back!. We are now using them again.",5
Roamright,"Didn't need to make a claim. However, on a past trip I had to cancel they handled it promptly.",5
Roamright,"In August we took a Caribbean cruise. My dad fell ill on the third day and had to be ambulanced to the hospital on St. Maarten. The total bill was over $5500, between the ship medical center, hospital, ambulance, etc. We called Roamright from the ship at sea right away, explained everything, they had a rep there to meet us and helped handle everything. They couldn't have been better. When we returned, I submitted all the documentation and they reimbursed within about two weeks. After such a traumatic event, they were professional, courteous, respectful, and paid out without hassle. One thing to keep in mind for any travel insurance is to be sure you have all the bills from the various places, marked paid and signed, and if possible, proof of payment. When you are so jangled this would be something easily overlooked and might be hard to obtain later from another country. I highly recommend RoamRight!",5
Roamright,"Medical IssuesOn the last two cruises we has some minor, but very unpleasant medical issues.  Had to visit the ship's medical center for exam and medication.  RoamRight reimbursed us on the first and we are confident that they will reimburse us for the costs on our most recent cruise.We would highly recommend RoamRight.  Good coverage, good price and great service.",5
Roamright,I have used RoamRight for all of my international trips since 2013 after experiencing the challenges of having a family member evacuated due to medical issues in another country.,5
Roamright,Web site is very informative and extremely easy to use.,5
Roamright,"Excellent service excellent timing, very satisfied and we will always recommend your services to our friends and family",5
Roamright,Had a great customer service experience. Very easy to set up and manage the process. Provides peace of mind while traveling out of the country.,5
Roamright,"Very easy to book and now can go with piece of mind to Spain,",5
Roamright,Luckily I have never had to make a claim but it fast and easy to purchase a policy.,5

Roamright,haven't had to make any claims but the buying process was easy and I liked the annual offerings.,5
Roamright,RoamRight was easy to buy and on their website it was broken down into 2 simple packages. Like any insurance whats within the packages is always confusing but i decided to go with the middle one. We were set to go on a cruise in Sept but with all the hurricanes our cruise was cancelled. I filed a claim with Roam-right and sent in all the paperwork. It took about 30 days to process but once it was processed I got my check in the mail shortly after. I am very glad i got Roam-right for our trip. I knew it was risky going on a cruise in peak hurricance season and luckily Roam-right had my back. Thank you,4
Roamright,"The purchase part is easy and the price is good.  However, the claims service is lousy.I went to Africa in the spring, came down with a migraine headache which made it impossible for me to take the long air travel back to US from Africa.  We were in remote area with no hospital or doctor near by.  I explained this in detail and send in my doctor's visits in US and MRI reports.  The claim was turned down.I emailed to claims with more information on 8/14/17 with no response.  On 11/25/17 I follow up on my 8/14/17 email; as of today, no response and no acknowledgement of receiving the email.  Very disappointing.",2
Roamright,"RoamRight service let me down when I needed it.  I regret putting my trust in this company.    Most people, myself included, purchase insurance mainly for the purpose of recovering costs in case of a cancellation.  However, as part of the product we purchase there are also additional services, such as consultation and help in case of a medical emergency.  I just happened to need that part of the service I PAID FOR.  I had a problem with my eye and needed an urgent check by ophthalmologist in a spanish-speaking country.  I don't speak spanish and needed an english-speaking doctor.  Finding one is not easy for a traveler and that's what RoamRight service was supposed to step in and provide help.  Instead: -two (2!) days after requesting an URGENT assistance I was given a Google-generated list of spanish-speaking doctors.  Thanks a lot!  By then, of course, I already got help elsewhere.  Given that experience I don't see myself using this service again.",2
Roamright,"I fell in Xian, China 5 days into the trip. Attempts to contact you were unsuccessful. Two days later I had my daughter contact you from the states. You emailed me a form to fill out and I was to see a doctor when we got to Shanghai. I was onboard a boat on the Yangtze. There was no way to print the forms off. The tour director had me forward the email to him. What tried 4 times. He couldn't receive it. We arrived in Shanghai Friday night. We attempted to open my email on the hotel computers. To no avail. There was no point in going to a doctor if I couldn't print off the forms but I still had to pay $100.00 American money to the tour director because he had arranged for someone to take me. We flew back to the states on Sunday",2
Roamright,I wish giveing you higher but I don’t have to use this trip .That was good thing.,3
Roamright,"The following review so terrified RoamRight's solipsistic defense team, they claimed it contained ""defamatory comments.""  Yeah, the TRUTH is defamatory to crooks, criminals and scam artists.  So they petition TrustPilot to remove critical reviews.  Shame on both!Very POOR COMMUNICATION!Very POOR communication skills. Like many exploitative online businesses, they demand their customers ""Open an Account"" -- usernames, password requirements, activation, etc. ANNOYING WASTE OF TIME. We attempted to fax our claim but their fax machine was out of order or offline, their website is a navigation nightmare, and after hours personnel admit they are an outsourced call center with little knowledge about travel business.This is particularly deceiving as they sell their policies under the rubric of offering 24/7 telephone and emergency support. BS. I called from London over weekend and the RoamRight operator told me she could not help, I'd have to call back Monday morning. Pathetic.All insurance companies make bags of money by denying your claims. RoamRight is little different demanding claims be filed using only their confusing, illiterate forms.My wife got sick while in the UK, Roam Right demanded we obtain medical records from the Provider, a Physician Statement, and waiver release of personal medical records to their front organization Arch Insurance Company and anyone they elect to distribute such records to.Very abusive. STAY AWAY if you want professional personnel to admin your insurance..",1
Roamright,Their website was very easy to understand and use. So I give them 5 stars for that. Our trip went without any issues so we never had to make a claim. So I don’t know who that would have gone.,5
Roamright,We did not need to use it and had no issues signing up online. We would use them again!,4
Roamright,I️ never had to use the insurance which is a good thing - I️ guess it was a competitively priced plan. Easy to sign up . Never heard back from company until now but I️ guess that’s normal.,4
Roamright,"easy to navigate and purchase, excellent phone app.",5
Roamright,"While we are frequent travelers, we rarely buy travel insurance.  But in 2017 with an extended trip to Alaska for 3 people, we decided to make the purchase.  And we are so glad we did.After some online research, we selected RoamRight.  They didn't offer the lowest price, but the combination of benefits coverage, price and traveler reviews convinced us RoamRIght was the right choice for us.About 2 weeks prior to our trip, and while traveling for business, I was transported by ambulance from a Chicago hotel to Northwestern Hospital.  After 3 days, I was discharged, but with doctor's instructions not to travel.  We immediately went about cancelling all our arrangements, but we were well with the 100% forfeiture window for our cruise line. We also were going to forfeit a substantial amount in airline penalties.We gathered all our documents, and submitted them online directly to RoamRight.  Several weeks later, and with no additional hassles or problems, our refund checks arrived for cruise fares and airline fees.The claims process was simple, easy and fast -- all done online in less than an hour once we gathered the required documents.  Follow-up communication was equally easy.We definitely will use RoamRight again in the future, and highly recommend this company.",5
Roamright,"I have used this insurance company for many of my car rentals, the custom service was great when I had problem trying to do it online and had problems I just called and the custom service rep. that help me was great.

Roamright,"I had always insured my trips and cruises, but I never had to use the insurance before. I have heart failure and my health took a turn for the worse so I had to cancel my long awaited cruise just before I had to pay the balance. I submitted my claim for the deposit and the cost of reinstating my miles and I got my check in about 3 weeks. A very positive experience. Thanks RoamRight.",5
Roamright,Excellent!! Everyone I have spoken to on the phone was wonderful and helpful ! Professional!,5
Roamright,We didn’t have to use it but we had peace of mind.,5
Roamright,"I have used this service on three trips to date. One in the spring 2017,and twice in October this year. The spring trip was uneventful. The first Oct trip was not good as it was for a trip overseas to Barcelona   While at the airport, the flight was canceled due to airport strike in Barcelona. The airlines refunded our fares immediately. Unfortunately we had put a non refundable deposit on an Airbnb place to stay. We opted to not go to Barcelona due to all of the civil unrest going on. We filed with RoamRight for the lost deposit. All of the necessary paperwork was sent and confirmed receipt sent by them giving me a reference number and an account adjuster. We subsequently booked a trip for the following week to Italy and we again purchased a policy from RoamRight. That trip was fine.To date we have received nothing from RoamRightFor our problem trip. I have called and the person who is handling my claim has not gotten back to me with a resolution. Over a month has passed.The initial reimbursement receptionist was very professional but so far the adjuster is a ghost. So for ease of purchase and ease of filing it’s pretty good but on the receiving end not good. To date my claim has not been resolved.UPDATEEffective today I received an apology from the claims manager for the length of time that has transpired. He told me to expect a check  for the full amount in the next 5-7 days. Very courteous. That’s what I expected and they have retained me as a customer. The reason for the delay was due to all of the claims related to the back to back hurricanes suffered in the Caribbean   OK... I change my rating to 4.5 stars.",4
Roamright,"I purchased insurance with RoamRight for the first time last summer (used other companies before) and ran into trouble on my trip almost immediately; bad weather delayed my outbound flight to Dublin and although Aer LIngus got me to Edinburgh, I was a day late and missed my connecting domestic flight. Roam Right has reimbursed me without any hassles for the cost of that new ticket. Also as soon as I reached Dublin I emailed the Help Line and was reassured that someone was there to help a solo older travelerl they started the claim file, gave me information about the next available flights, etc. 748856",5
Roamright,"The employees at  RR are always so efficient, helpful, patient and cheerful.  They are a joy to work with.  Today at the crack of dawn lovely gentleman from Chicago helped me.  This afternoon  Jen helped me but everyone over the years I have used RR has always been helpful. The only time i had a claim it was paid in full.Many Thanks,Karla",5
Roamright,"This review covers the purchase process of a RoamRight Preferred Plan.  I called their toll free number and spoke with Jen.  I had a lot of off the wall questions trying to make sure our unique circumstances were covered.  She knew most of the answers and for a few she briefly put me on hold to check with claims to make sure my questions were answered.  She was very thorough, friendly and professional.",5
Roamright,We purchased a preferred plan before our family trip with the primary goal of being able to cancel before going if something unexpected came up.   While we were on our trip though Hurricane Harvey kept us from getting home and we had to stay a couple extra days.   We saved all our receipts and submitted a trip delay claim.   It took three weeks to be processed (I had expected that after reading other reviews) but they reimbursed us for the full amount with no hassle.   Would definitely purchase from RoamRight again!,5
Roamright,"It took 3 calls to get my policy emailed to me...”No, it was not hiding in junk.  Finally it arrived today -after I called again...one month after money was deducted from my account for this policy.  Even if I was insured...it seems to me that if RoamRight can IMMEDIATELY deduct a years payment from my bank account...then they should IMMEDIATELY send me the policy information.  Companies don’t care anymore how they do business.  Should I  just cancel this policy?   Is this an indication of how they handle claims?  Makes me wonder🤔",2
Roamright,This is the first time I've ever bought trip insurance and I'm so glad that I did. We were traveling as a family of 5 to Mexico and I ended up having to file a claim for all of us. First my mother in law was not able to make the trip with us due to a death in the family 2 days before our trip. Then while we were in Mexico Hurricane Irma hit Florida and our return flights were cancelled. We had to buy last minute tickets on another airline to get back home. Once we got back to the states I filed the claim for trip cancellation on my mother in law as well as for our return flights. I was nervous that they would come back and give me a hard time but that was not the case at all. Our claims were all processed within a month and checks sent back to us. I'm so happy that I purchased this insurance and I will always be a customer for future trips! Definitely worth the money.,5

Roamright,Have always bought travel insurance and we have never had to use it until our last trip. Due to Hurricane Irma we had to cancel our vacation. The claim process was easy and we received our checks today.  We have scheduled another trip in December and have already purchased another policy with RoamRight. I will recommend this company to anyone,5
Roamright,"Impressed how straight forward the process was. Came back with lots of choices and a price that was half of what I was expecting. Leaves more play money for the trip. Hopefully, I won't have to find out if the actual recovery process is as straight forward.",5
Roamright,Fast and excellent service!  Thank you.,5
Roamright,"The customer service is outstanding.  Have used RoamRight for several years.  I only have one complaint, regarding submitting a claim at the web site:  after you fill out the forms and submit the claim, you do not get a copy of your claim sent to your email address, and there is no feature on the web site to let you view or edit your claim.  All you can do is edit the list of uploaded documents.  If you call the claims office they will email your claim to you, but I think this should be automatic, you should not have to call about that.  Bottom line: screen-shot your filled-out forms before clicking submit.  Roam Right Web Team: Please fix this, it is an unacceptable annoyance.",5
Roamright,"I'm not sure what rating to give since I didn't have to use it or have a claim. It's rather costly for having ""peace of mind"". However I plan to purchase it for future travel and I hope I never have occasion to use this service.",4
Roamright,We were unlucky enough to have our trip delayed by storms and missed the first day of our Caravan tour and we were reimbursed for tjis,5
Roamright,Easy to enroll and the details of the coverage are very clear and second to none. Felt very confident that if we had any issues traveling we would be covered and taken care of immediately.,5
Roamright,Very informative reps. Great price for the protection.   Best part was that I did not have to use the policyWill use again in the future.,5
Roamright,we took out an insurance policy with Rome right but fortunately never had to use it so we were perfectly happy thank you very much,5
Roamright,The travel insurance provided me with the security of knowing that I am well protected when I travel. Thank God I did not have to use the insurance coverage and it will cover me for one more trip yet.Thank youBruce Waldner,4
Roamright,"I have only had to purchase a plan this far, but the booking process was very simple. I was online comparing the different plans, but I did have specific questions regarding the plan coverage. I do not purchase anything without understanding the fine print.All of my questions were answered with patience, kindness, and with full explanation as well as followed up by the customer service representative asking if I understood everything that she explained to me. We travel A LOT, so going forward I will be sure to purchase travel insurance plans through Roam Right. If I have to make a claim (praying I won't) I will give separate review through my husband's Yelp account referring to this review post.Plan pricing is very competitivePlan coverage is better than some of the leading travel insurance companiesMedical coverage is better than majority of the leading companies I compared to",5
Roamright,"I have never purchased trip insurance before.  We were going on a big trip to Aruba so I decided to go ahead and get it to be on the safe side.  Unfortunately, a few weeks before we were to leave, my husband pulled his back out and was in agonizing pain and couldn't move.  There was no way we could take the trip.  As disappointing as this was, it would have been worse if we had lost all the money we paid for the airfare and hotel.  RoamRight made the claims process painless and easy, and we were fully reimbursed for our expenses.  Thank you!  We will definitely recommend you to everyone.  Hopefully the next time we won't actually need it, but it definitely gave me peace of mind.",5
Roamright,"At this point I have only used the website to purchase insurance and it couldn't have been an easier process.  I especially appreciate how easy it was to set up my account after purchasing insurance, unlike Priceline.com where you can't add your trips to your profile if you aren't already logged in prior to purchase.  Great pricing on easily customizable products from verified providers.",5
Roamright,The cruise went well. Fortunately did not need to call on DownRight to resolve any issues. Piece of mind well worth the cost of policy.,5
Roamright,"There really was no friction. We had no need to use the insurance, which is a good thing so I don't feel I can honestly rate those services.",3
Roamright,"Purchasing the insurance was easy.  The policy represented the exact coverage we needed for our journey.  The cost was a bit on the higher side but the coverage provided far exceed most other companies.  Thankfully, we did not have to test the claims process which would really test how good Roam Rigth is - but on the face I would strongly recommend.  Their insurance rating within the industry AM Best and other is very strong.  Before purchasing any policy with any company make sure to check the companies rating.  I would use Roam Right again.",5
Roamright,"Easy to purchase, did not have to use the insurance (thankfully).  This is the second time I have purchased a policy, neither time did I need to use it so I can not comment on claims procedures.",5
Roamright,Good health protection and medical evacuation coverage at a reasonable price,5
Roamright,"We had never purchased travel insurance before but due to my father's ongoing health concerns, there was a good possibility the trip might need to be cancelled. It turned out we needed the insurance due to trip delays for ourselves with one flight being delayed with us arriving 12 hours later than expected and a flight being cancelled twice (two days in a row). We would have been stuck in airports for days or spent a large amount of money out-of-pocket had we not had insurance. Each time we called RoamRight to ask about benefits, filing a claim or the claim status, the representative clearly answered all of our questions and helped to set our expectations of the claims process. I hope never to need to make another trip insurance claim but we'll be getting trip insurance from RoamRight from now on even for ""simple"" vacations . The cost was minimal and now we know firsthand how helpful it is to have these benefits if the needs arise.",5
Roamright,Didn't need to use it but I felt secure having it.,5
Roamright,The best thing about having it was that we didn't have to use it. Thank you for being there. We love the Roam Right blog.,5
Roamright,"My trip to the Outer Banks was in jeopardy due to the power outage. While we were ultimately able to complete our vacation, the reassurance I received from RoamRight and their claim staff put my mind at ease.",5
Roamright,"Filing a claim due to an illness was fine, up until the point where AFTER I file, I'm shown a link to a form I ""may need"" a doctor to fill out. Nowhere else in the process was there mention of this physician's statement, or a link to it. How incredibly confusing, frustrating and dishonest business practice. I waited until I had all of my documents to send in one neat submission, and now I have to go back to my daughter's physician and bug them with more paperwork. Oh, and that release of information? I can't even sign it digitally. It's almost as if your company is making it as hard as possible to file so you don't have to pay us money. Thank you for making what was already a bad travel experience even worse. The only reason I'm not giving this one star is because the people I spoke with on the phone have been nice enough.",2
Roamright,"Great service. Used RoamRight several times for many different trips already. The only thing, regarding the website, is to automatically add policies/orders without having to do it manually.Thanks!",5
Roamright,Two years ago we went to Madagascar and had several cancelled flights because of an Air Madagascar strike.  We had insurance with another company and it took six months of many requests for more information before we received our payment.  Arch Insurance received our forms for our cancelled trip to Africa on July 6 and we had our payment by July 22. I will never use another company for travel insurance,5
Roamright,"Kathy, the lady in customer service who took my call, helped a know nothing like me and patiently took in my information, answered questions, and explained the nuances of the coverage.  I bought a policy for a trip planned in September.  I tell you this because I rarely come across people in customer service positions that are as helpful as was Kathy.  Thank you.chuck weber",5

Roamright,"I thought I was dealing with a legitimate insurance company--and perhaps you are but I had a very strange and frustrating experience when I tried (unsuccessfully) to log into/create an account so I could access my policy while on my trip. When asking for a temporary password, the alpha numeric characters included symbols that were mysteriously not present on the keyboard offered in the app. I tried requesting another password and the same thing happened. It was quite bizarre. Thankfully I didn't have any problems on my trip that needed coverage, so I am still left with questions about the validity of your company.",1

Roamright,"My son had an insect bite and we called the 800 number. It was a very painful process and we were told someone would be calling us the next day and we have yet to hear anything. I tried calling again and was told I would receive a call, I still have not! Very poor customer service!",1
Roamright,"Great price for a good nights sleep. I add the cancel for any reason to my policy. Although I have never used my policy, I do sleep well at night knowing that if something came up, I would be covered. I always use RoamRight.",5
Roamright,"I've used Roam Right twice.  The first time, my son did a one-month gap year program in Thailand.  He developed an infection and Roam Right helped us every step of the way -- from finding a hospital to prompt reimbursement of bills to follow-up emails and phone calls to make sure all was well.  The second time, my son spent two weeks in Argentina.  I purchased a medical evacuation policy the day before he left and I had total peace of mind that Roam Right would be there we needed them.  Thankfully, we did not.  :)",5
Roamright,"Quick, easy and affordable with several coverage options.",5
Roamright,On our last to trips to Africa we have used RoamRight insurance. We have be thrilled that we did.  Each time we have had trip delays due to illness and each time RoamRight processed our claims promptly and to our complete satisfaction.,5
Roamright,"She was very helpful.  Only problem, the update has not been forwarded to me to see the corrections and current information.",4
Roamright,"I always used Protect Your Bubble for my rental car insurance but they changed their coverage and recommended RoamRight in their place.  Purchased a policy for a rental car for two days.  Ended up canceling the rental car and tried to cancel my RoamRight policy.  Rental car canceled without any issues.  RoamRight said they were unable to cancel as I accidentally purchased travel insurance and not rental car insurance and I was only able to cancel within a limited time frame.  The customer service agent was apologetic and said maybe a manager would at least give me credit to use in the future and gave me an email address to discuss my situation and they never replied.Update:  After posting my initial review, RoamRight responded the next day apologizing for the overlook due to a new email server and administered my credit straightaway.  I appreciate the rectification of the issue very much though I imagine it never would have been fixed had I not posted the review about my negative experience.  Because of this good gesture, I will not be against giving them another chance in the future.  Thank you!",3
Roamright,"Darlene with Roam Right was so very friendly and helpful when I was purchasing coverage for my trip to Sicily. I was also very pleased with the fact that I could actually speak with a person, rather than automation.",5
Roamright,"My second time with Roamright. And, my second time for not having to use the benefits. I tend to think that if I didn't have it, something bad might happen. But that's not true, having Roamright helps me think only about enjoying my trip.",5
Roamright,"I'm a long time customer.  Everything seems great if you don't have a problem because you don't need to contact them.  Their representatives don't share the same information with you.  I was going by what I was told and they refused to honor it!Reply to Roamright:  There should be a record of 4 contacts with you for my recent policy.  It isn't a claim issue.  You sent out an email saying, ""We know you're in a terrorist attack area and we're happy to help.  Our representatives are trained.""  NONE were...and you're reply is that I cannot extend your policy expiration date because I wanted to pick a new return date to avoid unsafe travel.  But you offered to sell me a new policy to cover those new days.  Crazy!Even if your policy is to indeed be inflexible with peoples' return dates---your staff was rude about it.  She could deliver the bad news with a little care.  She could offer to let me speak to a manager trained better.  I was told in the past that it's OK to return early but to call and let you know if I'm coming home late.  I didn't want to make a claim, just extend my travel dates.  Thanks for nothing!And thanks for your jaded response below trying to make it look like Roamright is a perfect company without addressing any issues.",2

Roamright,"Purchasing was simple. We have purchased Roam Right for a number of trips, however we have never had to file a claim, or had a circumstance that warranted use. Sort of like carrying an umbrella, if you do, it never rains!",5
Roamright,"Had to cancel our trip due to family matters. Our claim was fully honored, although it took some time, and the communication during the claim process was a bit confused. We will use Roam Right again for future travel.",4
Roamright,"We have been using RoamRight Travel insurance for several years now; and, we do not book a vacation that we don't also purchase travel insurance.  While we have been truly ""BLESSED""; and, never had to file a claim, the Customer Service dept has been extremely helpful providing Policy #'s, helping us navigate their website and adding beneficiaries to our travel policies.We'd rather have travel insurance; and, not need it; than find out we need it; and, not have it; therefore, we recommend ""ROAMRIGHT"" to all our family & friends that travel; and, we never leave home without our ""ROAMRIGHT"" travel insurance card in-hand!",5
Roamright,I had to submit a claim for my most recent trip. Within two days of submitting my claim I received a response of more information needed. The following week I received my reimbursement I was claiming.,5
Roamright,"I researched various companies a year ago.  The RoamRight Preferred package was the best I could find considering coverage, user reviews and price.  I saw no reason to change carriers for my more recent trips.  Having made no claim on three trips, I have no experience with their claims settlements.",4
Roamright,"I was initially unable to complete my plans for trip in 2016 and was extended thru this Sept.  My European trip completed without incident, and I was grateful for coverage!  I wd use u again!",5
Roamright,Appreciate the ease of applying and receiving the confirmation in a very timely manner.,5
Roamright,"Thankfully we didn't need to file any insurance, the trip went smoothly. Just glad we had the policy in case something went wrong.  Pricing of the policy was good and the website was easy to use.",5
Roamright,"I've used roam right for 3 years now..... not had a claim,  but the online ordering and the cost were all in my.... happy zone!",5
Roamright,No review text found,4
Roamright,"RoamRight allowed me to hold my reservation from a previous trip that I cancelled due to illness.  Also, I was very impressed when contacted by RoamRight to check that I was okay after the  Manchester, ENG. terrorist attack.",5
Roamright,"I have always bought the policy, but luckily enough I have never had to use it.  Just knowing that I have a plan to fall back on in case of an emergency, gives me peace of mind.  Your sales representatives  are always courteous and helpful when I try and get a new policy  issued for my next trip.   Keep up the good work.",5
Roamright,Website easy to understand and navigate. Customer Service prompt and friendly.,5
Roamright,Comfort to know RoamRight was there if I ever needed help.  My family knows I like to travel and felt very assured that if problems arose I had help available very quickly.  Reasonable price and excellent coverage.,5
Roamright,I had a claim with RoamRight.  The service was fast and fair.  I would definitely use them again and recommend them to other travelers.,5
Roamright,"Have used RR twice. Both times, they were quite helpful and accommodating. Most recently we had to cancel a flight to Japan for health reasons. They reimbursed us promptly, exactly as promised.  Almost hard to believe it's an insurance company!",5
Roamright,"My wife and I purchased a Multi-trip annual Plan in January since we planned on taking several short trips this year.  On our first trip a few weeks later, my wife tore her ACL skiing, necessitating that we return home early.  We then had to cancel two other planned trips due to post op travel restrictions.  After turning in all the paper work, we were reimbursed for our out of pocket medical and travel costs for all three trips without any issues in about a month. And since we didn't reach our limits we still have some coverage for the rest of the year. .",5
Roamright,"Refund in full without any major hassles.  Notification of refund took about 4 weeks, now awaiting actual payment.",5
Roamright,Fortunately I didn't need to use the insurance but happy to know it was there.,5
Roamright,"Easy to use, great customer service and great provider of peace of mind",5
Roamright,"Kathy, you are the true definition of what a customer service should be. Your patience, dedication and work ethics is second to none. You exemplify excellence and you treat customers like Royalty, by exceeding expectations, every moment.You rock, dear Kathy!!",5
Roamright,"After interviewing 6 other travel insurance firms, I chose RoamRight based on their ability to communicate clearly as well as responding to all of my questions. Darlene B, working out of their Maryland call center, assisted me with the RoamRight Essential Travel Plan. Darlene was very supportive and understanding which led me to decide on RoamRight for my travel insurance needs.",5
Roamright,Very easy-to-navigate website. A live person available on the phone. High security for very affordable premium.,5
Roamright,Fortunately I did not need to use my insurance during a recent trip but the process of obtaining the premium was very straightforward and easy over the telephone. The cost of $28 to cover medical emergencies was quite affordable. I would not hesitate to use RoamRight again and would recommend this to my friends.,5
Roamright,"First off: I was eventually reimbursed for everything. But it took more than a month and tons of babysitting on my part. I had cancel-for-any-reason insurance and first submitted claim without medical documentation. I did not know that would only get me 75% reimbursed (that's my fault - but it would have been very helpful to be notified of that in claim process). It took a long time to get the first 75% - it should be a slam dunk to get these funds as it's a super straightforward claim. I subsequently submitted documentation to get remainder 25%. It felt very slow and like I had to stay on top of the process. This is just my take - but it seemed like if I didn't keep pushing, we would not have been reimbursed fully.",3
Roamright,"Only 4 stars because I haven't left on my trip yet. But I had such a horrible experience with Allianz , which has given me a 3 day headache. East to purchase, good coverage for a reasonable price. I have not had to make a claim, but if I have to I expect I will receive the same quality of service.",4
Roamright,Did not need insurance but customer service and pricing were great. Will use again,5
Roamright,"We did not have to use our insurance but I liked how the app gave up to date information on issues related to where we were traveling. I also thought the coverage cost was reasonable for everything that was included in the policy. With six people traveling, I felt assured that if one of the people on our trip had a problem, it could be taken care of with Roam Right insurance. I will use them again the next time we travel.",5
Roamright,This was the best inusrance I have ever had to purchase. My trip to Mallorca Spain in August of 2015 I purchased this for my trip over seas. I said the night I was buying the insurance why do I need this I never use the insurance and thought of it being a waste of money. Turns out I was completely wrong. I had a life changing motor bike accident. If i didint have this insurance I am not sure I would have been able to make it out of the hosiptal and home door to door service with an amazing nurse that really helped take such good care of me. They helped rebook my ticket home and took care of many medical expenses and other expenses that came from my accident. I am so greatful and forever thankful and have turned into a complete believer of Roam Right. since this time I have shared to everyone I know about this insurance and everything they did to keep me safe and communicate with my family back in the united states. This insurance saved my life. Everyone should use it if they plan on traveling over seas.,5
Roamright,"easy, inexpensive - we use use RoamRight for every vacation",5
Roamright,"I had insurance for a trip to Ireland.   I broke my ankle and wasn't able to go.  I called Roam Right, downloaded some forms from their website, got the requisite info, sent in the documentation and two weeks later I had a check reimbursing me for the appropriate expenses.   i have since purchased additional insurance for a 5 week trip that i just completed.Clearly, I have used them over the years many times and have faith that if anything happened while on a trip, Roam Right would be there to take care of the situation.",5
Roamright,We didn't need to use the insurance but we felt comfortable having it!,5
Roamright,I have used Roamright a couple of times for travel insurance and they are easy to use and helpful.,5
Roamright,Good company- easy to contact,5
Roamright,No issues - very simple process.  Fortunately we didn't have a claim,5
Roamright,All of the right information was where I needed to see it.  Simple and easy purchase!,5
Roamright,"While on our 17 day trip to Australia in Sept 2016 my husband ended up with a kidney stone.  The medical from office calls to imaging was great, much less at a fraction of the cost we pay in North America.  We had purchased Roam Right Travel Ins. and will never do a major trip without it.  We had to pay for the everything with Credit Card and then submit it to our Insurance when we returned.  The only thing to realize it is a secondary insurance so I had to submit everything to our medical insurance and then file a claim with Roam Right for anything which hadn't been covered.  It took our insurance 4 months to complete the claim which I then submitted all documentation to Roam Right.  Just a note get copies of all bills, receipts of payment, and credit card statements.  They were very explicit on what documentation was needed.  After submitting all the files I received a confirmation the next morning that they had received the paperwork and wood be reviewing shortly which it states can take up to a month.  In a month I received a check to cover all expenses not picked up by our Insurance.  Couldn't have asked for more and its well worth the piece of mind should have it been even more serious or totally interrupted the remainder of the trip.  Thank You Roam Right for the prompt service.",5
Roamright,"On the last day of our trip I felt strong pain, and did not know what was going on. I needed to see a doctor. The earliest appointment was next day, and we missed our flight. We re-booked the flight and had to pay extra. Next day the doctor gave me OK to fly, and next evening we were home. I filed a claim for extra flight expenses. The submission process was fairly simple, all documents we filed by email and the paperwork was minimal. The claim was processed and paid fairly quickly.",5
Roamright,"Our experience with RoamRight was very professional and timely.  We upgraded our policy to include the ""cancel for any reason"" option to cover a vacation house in AZ.  1 month prior to our scheduled departure we needed to cancel.  The customer service agent was very friendly and helpful.  I scanned in all the required documents, emailed once to follow up and received our check quickly.  Very pleased with the entire process.  I'm glad I took the time to carefully read all the coverage options and selected the one that best covered our needs for this vacation.  My family will use RoamRight again when planning our next vacation - thank you!",5
Roamright,Very simple and affordable.,5
Roamright,I appreciate how friendly and helpful everyone is at RoamRight.It makes caring for the people that go to Haiti to help out at The Joseph School much easier!Thanks!,5
Roamright,"Austin was a great help. She was clear, succinct and answered all of my questions. I felt informed and reassured by our conversation, and wish there were more people like her in customer service!Very pleasant experience, thank you!",5
Roamright,This company's Essential policy provides good basic coverage at an affordable rate.   I just purchased the policy for a future trip.  I had made an error on the online application form and customer service by phone helped me in a pleasant and clear manner. .,5
Roamright,"While traveling in Singapore my husband was hospitalized. Using the emergency number on the RoamRight app I was able to start the process of getting help from the company. My husband was in the hospital for 5 nights, and not fit to fly for 7. The company sent a emergency nurse to travel home with us without any hassle at all. The claim was easy to complete and we were reimbursed for our out of pocket expenses. Thank you RoamRight for your help. I am thankful we chose your company for our trip. Highly recommended.",5
Roamright,"Filed a Trip Interruption claim 11/20/16. Had to leave my family vacation on a Sunday morning because my dad fell and broke his hip. Decided to rent a car so the rest of the family (also insured) did not have to return early. Their ""On-Call"" people were friendly but had no idea if the rental would be covered so I chanced it. Later I spoke several times with the Claims Dept who were very friendly and helpful.  Around Dec 10 I called to check on the status of my claim, was told they ""needed the full month to review my claim since there were so many claims pending."" Was told it would be decided by 12/22. On 12/26 called back and suddenly my claim was approved. Got the full amount claimed on 1/3/17. Very friendly and courteous staff but IMO they are a bit slow and need too much prompting.",3
Roamright,I CAN TELL YOU I HAVE CONSISTENLY DONE BUSINESS WITH ROAMRIGHT DUE TO PRICE AND SERVICE!  YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS ARE ALWAYS POLITE AND KNOWLEGABLE!  ITS ALWAYS A PLEASURE CALLING YOUR COMPANY. THANKS SO MUCH. THOMAS DELIBERTO,5
Roamright,"It's been 2 months since I submitted my claim and until now they have not processed yet. I called 4 times for the last 1 month and I have different response from 4 different customer rep. Not sure what is going on. The response from their rep are from being in process to been approved and will be sending you the final amount by mail. As of today, December 29- 2016 , I called them again and just found out that they are still reviewing the case and should finalize soon. I have been asking them if they need additional info or documents to facilitate the processing of the claim, but they said no. So from what I could see, it's either they are trying to ignore me and hopefully I just forget the claim or they just want to delay until you give up. Try to avoid this company, it's a small amount of claim I submitted ( about $200+ ). How much more if the amount is bigger.",1
Roamright,A month passed by since the claim has been submitted. Roamright did not even touched my documents. Now they are asking me for the airline cancellation which I never knew I have to do.,1
Roamright,"Last September, I purchased travel insurance through Roam Right for a trip to Italy with departure date of 11/03/2016 returning 11/23/2016. On the day we were to fly back to the US, there was a strike of Lufthansa's  pilots' union that commenced, of all days,  that day. We felt secured knowing that, in the event we got stuck in Italy, we were covered. However, when I pulled out my policy, which was issued by SquareMouth, the return date shown is 11/09/2016. Luckily, the Lufthansa desk at Naples rebook us on their partner airlines Alitalia to Milan connecting with Air France to Paris and Los Angeles. This would have been an unforgiveable mistake of RoamRight (Adam, Product Mgr,  took my order via RoamRight chat line) had we got stuck in Italy. Although I was  responsible for checking the correctness of the  policy , I was busy preparing for the trip and it never occurred to me that that something  might be wrong with the policy. I based my purchase solely on positive customer reviews of RoamRight. Next time I'll take my business somewhere.",1
Roamright,"**Disclaimer: After 34 days of waiting and us sending multiple emails and calling to find out what is going on, we've been told they'll pay us out for trip delay, but will not include our baggage delay claim pay out.We submitted our claim on 10/12/2016. We called about two days later when we noticed that one of our claims, baggage delay, had been closed out. We were told that it was merged into the trip delay claim and not to worry.On day 31, after hearing nothing from roamright regarding our claim(so much for the 15 days they tout), I send an email. Three days later I get an email that our claim was paid and a check is in the mail. There is no explanation of benefits pay out or an amount.I call roamright and talk with an employee. She states they paid out our trip delay claim, but the required documentation was never received for the baggage claim. I asked her how I would know that since nobody ever contacted us about anything. She stated, ""I don't know, but I'm telling you now."" So, her sassiness was SUPER helpful.I told her that they had told us all the paperwork had been merged into one claim. She apparently did not care about that, because she insisted we had not sent in everything we need and they would not be paying out for it.Here I wait. Almost 5 weeks after submitting my claim, and I guess I'll cross my fingers that we get the pay out for at least one of my claims. I will NEVER use roamright again. What a nightmare!",1
Roamright,"Plain,simple service,no Hassel's.",5
Roamright,People were easy to work with.  Explained coverages and procedures completely.,5
Roamright,I had a claim that I sent in to RoamRight and the response was excellent. After submitting the paperwork they had requested they reimbursed me immediately. I cannot say enough good things about RoamRight!,5
Roamright,"very professional, polite and excellent service.Thank you,Marat Kogan",5
Roamright,"NOTE:. Trust Pilot Compliance has demanded I change my review so as to eliminate,""accusatory or defamitory"" statements.  While a Trustpilot review does NOT constitute a remark to a third party person, and IS protected by the First Amendment to the US Constitution., I am happy to indulge their need for indemnification.  Do NOT EXPECT the advertised services.  I called on a weekend expecting the 24/7 service advertised.  Instead I got an answering service so disconnected from the main office they were not authorised to locate my policy.  On weekends, holidays and after hours, RoamRite's 24/7 ""service"" will tell you to call back during business hours.  Shameful behavior.  With this deception setting the tone, it's doubtful you'll EVER get a benefit much less HELP during a travel emergency.STAY FAR FAR AWAY.  this is another insurance invention IMO!",1
Roamright,"It was quite straightforward & efficient to enroll in a program, and I was able to load an app to my mobile phone to have access to information if needed.  Fortunately, there was no need for any assistance at all, so my further experience with RoamRight is nil.",4
Roamright,Good price. No problems using it. Will definitely use it again!,5
Roamright,"I have not had a good experience with this insurance company so far.  I experienced trip interruption while traveling due to 24 hour flu bug.  I was so sick that I even went to an emergency room while traveling.  I was running a temperature when they took my vitals.  When I called to discuss this with a representative, he stated that I did not experienced trip interruption.  Shame on him.",1
Roamright,"I shopped around for travel insurance for a cruise, and found RoamRight to provide a reasonable, quality option. While I did not need to use the insurance, I did appreciate the informative and timely emails I received from them prior to the departure of my trip. I would use RoamRight in the future, and would recommend them to others.",5
Roamright,All i can say is that it was affordable and a nice piece of mind to keep with us during our trip. Enrollment was easy and in minutes we were able to print the credit card size card (in case we had a need to show some prove of international health insurance to access an hospital). Also we downloaded an app that informed us ahead of time of travel alerts and warnings in the country we visited.,5
Roamright,I purchased a policy last month for a trip to Spain. My new iPhone was stolen at an airport en-route home and upon my return I placed a claim online. It was easy to provide the information needed and it was processed in 10 days and check received the following week. Very happy with the experience.,5
Roamright,The primary reason for choosing this policy was that it provided coverage if the tour company went out of business.,5
Roamright,Above all mentions everything in a nutshell. Great services !!,5
Roamright,"nice to have the re-assurance that if something went wrong i had this coverage.  it was so easy to sign up, and a better product than is offered by airlines IMO.",5
Roamright,Have used other travel ins. companies in the past and was leery of RoamRight...not anymore...excellent customer service and response to claim filing! Will definitely use again!,5
Roamright,Hence I have no way to speak to the point.,5
Roamright,Good price good coverage prompt response,4
Roamright,I haven't had to file a claim either time but was at ease knowing I had great coverage.,5
Sevencorners,Communication with sales team and claims team was excellent.  Important to keep all documentation to substantiate a claim.  I faxed a package of invoices etcAnd received full reimbursement in 60 days.  No complaints.  Representatives were easy to talk to and helpful.  Best thing I can say is I would use Seven Corners again to insure a cruise vacation,5
Sevencorners,"While I was in France last October, my tooth broke off at the gum line. If that doesn't qualify as a dental emergency, nothing does. I went to a dentist to get it glued on temporarily so I could eat, which cost a big $72. Seven Corners denied this obviously legitimate claim, and it took them 2 months to do so. Thank God we didn't have bigger problems. This insurance is worthless. Avoid this company like the plague. By the way, we purchased the best policy they offered, LOL.",1
Sevencorners,"We are so grateful that your team decided to extend the period where policy changes can be made.  We experienced several delays in our trip (all of them out of our control) to a country that has experienced some serious political strive, making travel unsafe.  This extension was very much appreciated and we understand that you did not have to grant it.  Thank you for this!",5
Sevencorners,"Travel insurance purchased for an Israel trip, which has been cancelled and refunded for obvious reasons.  Seven Corners is unwilling to refund the travel insurance.  Granted, the contract states there is only a 14 day grace period, but given the circumstances in Israel and the fact Seven Corners had no outlay of money we thought they would promote customer relations and refund the money.  But they are refusing.  Yes, you can use the policy on another trip, but I was honest with them and stated that likely won't happen.  I also asked if the premium paid could be used for a number of smaller trips, but the response so far has been no (""the system doesn't allow"").  Escalation of this issue within Seven Corners has been ineffective.P.S.  Other companies ARE refunding travelers their premium expenses under similar circumstances.",1
Sevencorners,The company is trustworthy regarding insurance the process of claim is also good and they reimburse the claimed amount,5
Sevencorners,Doing all they can to avoid payment. Sending me multiple replies asking for more documents when everything needed provides. Very unhappy with the service. I recommend to avoid.,1
Sevencorners,very helpful and patient with me in sorting out several questions about my policy.. Thanks,5
Sevencorners,"Called to change travel dates on an existing policy. The woman I spoke to was fabulous ... knowledgeable, pleasant and efficient. She is a credit to her company!!!",5
Sevencorners,The reps made it easy to understand to available options.,5
Sevencorners,"Your agent, Autumn, was very helpful and knowledgeable.",5
Sevencorners,"Don't bother with this one.  Our claim was denied even though we had a physician's statement.  My travel partner suffered a worsening condition just before we were scheduled to leave for a cruise.  Lost the cost of the cruise and the policy premium.  They DO NOT cover 'for any reason' as they claim.  We were not denied because we didn't purchase the 'extras' plan, but because they said my partner had a pre-existing condition!  Most 70-year-olds have some type of pre-existing condition!",1
Sevencorners,I needed to change dates and a country I was visiting based on changes to a tour.  It was so easy!,5
Sevencorners,"I purchased  travel protection basic insurance for an intentional trip, just in case I needed medical attention. While traveling, a family member fell ill back in the US and I had to fly home unexpectedly. I reached out to Seven Corners after returning home to see if the policy could cover the cost of the ticket due to the medical emergency and the representative let me know it could cover up $1,000 if I had proper back up documentation. I filled out the paperwork, submitted the claim, and it was approved and the money was deposited into my account. One thing to know, it wasn’t a quick process. I filed the claim in October and it wasn’t reviewed until December. I had to resubmit the physicians form and then it was approved in January. I received the direct deposit to my account with 48 hours of the approval though! I would definitely use them again and look to add in the plan that fully reimburses costs due to a medical emergency/trip interruption.",5
Sevencorners,"I've had a solid experience with these guys. Not impeccable communication, but really didn't have any complaints and will definitely use again.",5
Sevencorners,Fast and good phone service. Long delays in processing claim and constantly asking for additional information.,4
Sevencorners,No review text found,5
Sevencorners,"When I fell and injured my knee (requiring a visit to an E.R.), Seven Corners was seamless from from start to finish. The phone representatives were so friendly and helpful. I received my reimbursement in less than a month. I will definitely purchase the same product for future trips!",5
Sevencorners,"It took over a month to get our money back, which I felt was a bit slow, but I had no problems. My husband and I got COVID and were not able to go on our trip. We had both been paying separately for our portion of the trip through EF Ultimate Break for about a year and we both got our full amount back by submitting the physician statement and some medical records.",5
Sevencorners,"I contacted you but  It is not helpful for emergency service. When I went to ER,  I paid medical expense fully. The insurance didn’t help.",3
Sevencorners,The person I talked to was very helpful & informative.  I will have to admit I do not like these surveys!,5
Sevencorners,Very nice employees that are very helpful!,5
Sevencorners,"I have used this company several times but never had to make a claim.  I made a claim for a trip I took in August/September of 2023.  I had to make an emergency trip home because my son was hospitalized.  I had to change my return ticket to see him. Because of a clause on page 12 of the policy, I was denied $1000 because I returned to a different city than the original city.  It was a perfect example of an insurance company using obscure rules to deny a claim.  I will never use them again.",1
Sevencorners,"Today I called and spoke to representative Cindy who checked to make sure all forms were received. She was polite and checked everything out and told us we were in review and would take another 30 days until determination.  The paperwork and forms were difficult to fill all out on line.Frustrating! On  August 25 EF Go Ahead Tours communicating to file claim.  Still going on, waiting for refund.  CINDY WAS VERY HELPFUL!cert# F 5E029B05563",5
Sevencorners,"Very knowledgeable,  and helpful staff!",5
Sevencorners,"It’s been 3 months since I filed my claim on September 1, 2023 with Seven Corners. Six weeks later I received notice they needed additional information, which I provided the same day. Seven Corners acknowledged receipt. That was October 11, 2023 - 50 days ago!  For the record and for anyone reading this review, Seven Corners’ process is to try resolve a claim within 30 days. However, anytime they need additional information the clock gets reset to zero and the 30-day clock starts all over again. I was told this by one of their agents. Since October 11th I have called several times to get claim status.  Each time I talked with an agent they found an error with the dates within their internal tracking system and was then told my claim would be escalated to the “escalation team”.  This was done on October 25th and again on November 20th. Each time I received a form letter from a nameless person on the “escalation team” telling me my claim has been escalated and says my “patience and understanding are highly appreciated”.  Well, after 3 months my patience is gone, and I don’t understand why my claim is taking so long.  Can someone at Seven Corners please help me with understanding this?",1
Sevencorners,"I needed to speak with someone on a weekend and no one was available.  My luggage was damaged on the flight, but didn’t notice it until unpacking at the hotel.  Tried to call on a Saturday, but was informed by answering that no one would be there til Monday.  Our tour started on Sunday so I was unable to place the return call.  Had to purchase new luggage at my own cost to get home.",2
Sevencorners,"Why is my claim taking so long ($6,900). All needed material has been sent--Drs. letters---credit card payments---cruise co cancel info--travel co. letter of payment and cancel--ETCEach time same notice --info sent for review---It seems I always have been sent to the rear of the linr.I will be needing ins. for 2 future cruises--(I've been on 33 and only had to cancel 2 cruises that required Travel ins. intervention.I'm having second thoughts about Seven Corners!!Let me know why I should continue to use your Co.First contact to Seven Corners about claim  7/19/23",2
Sevencorners,"I purchased travel coverage with Seven Corners ($648) before embarking on a trip in July 2022.  Whilst travelling, I broke my ankle and elbow simultaneously.  I submitted complete claim form along with a spread sheet listing each expense, copies of invoices, explanation of costs as well as proof of payment for each expense.  I was reimbursed a total of $1098.  This is a net of $450 after the premium.    Important to note is that any related physical therapy or other expenses 90 days past the date of incident were denied!  Not only did the insurance cover a pittance of my total cost, it took 18 months to recover this measly sum and the cost of my time to pursue this claim far exceeds the reimbursed amount.  The  amount of paperwork they requested in addition to the receipts and proof of payment was nothing short of nauseating.It is BLANTANTLY evident that Seven Corners modus Operandi revolves around finding flimsy excuses to either deny claims outright or systematically drain the claimant will to pursue rightful compensation. Their tactics are not only despicable but also emblematic of a company that prioritizes profit over the well-being of its clients.   Seven Corners is a complete disgrace.  I advise anyone considering their services to save  themselves the premium, headache and immense frustration. Steer clear of this company at any cost if you value your peace of mind and financial stability.   I will be using other reputable company’s like American Express moving forward. NEVER AGAIN",1
Sevencorners,"They denied a claim for a return flight after my daughter's connecting flight was cancelled. They said they'd cover reasonable transportation, hotel, etc but not a return flight. COMPLETELY NOT OK TO EXPECT A MINOR SHOULD BE LEFT IN A MAJOR CITY OVERNIGHT UNACCOMPANIED! AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS! The flight I booked to get her home was less than the costs of a hotel and uber.",1
Sevencorners,Made deposit on trip for April 2024 of $99 in May then a payment of $475.80 for June & $475.80 for July.  In August I had to cancel trips for financial reasons only to be to told financial is not covered.  Only physical was acceptable!   Totally shocking & unacceptable to receive about $325 back . . .& losing over $700!   As if anyone - any age - could not have to cancel a trip a year away.  Will never use EF tours or 7 Corners again.  Shame on you . . . Letting everyone know how you keep $ that doesn’t belong to you.  You get zero stars!!,1
Sevencorners,"When seven corners denied my claim, I was really upset. Laura and I connected via Seven Corners facebook page. She went out of her way to help me submit an appeal and get it approved",5
Sevencorners,Seven Corners was very helpful in getting our trip insurance for our South Africa trip. We had some problems getting there so now I’m filling out a claim for our lost vacation time. I’m assuming that Seven Corners is going to be just as helpful and fair in this process.,5
Sevencorners,"Easy to make contact with the correct staff.  The woman I contacted was personable and helpful -- she understood my question about extending the return date and quickly made the change after reconfirming my new date.  And, she was easy to understand as well as an overall good speaker.  I was impressed by her ability to quickly locate my policy, review my return date change, and make changes to the policy as well as to forward the revised policy in a very, very short time.  I believe she would be good at teaching others how to provide great service.",5
Sevencorners,"Ms. Wade was SUPER  helpful!! After our call ended, she called me to let me know only ONE person in my family had received reimbursement. I am so grateful she noticed this and emailed me the documents to complete and submit for reimbursement.  OUTSTANDING customer service!!",5
Sevencorners,"What a joke.  Replied to their customer care as indicated and I get an email form letter response that their advisors are all fully trained and I could file an appeal if I wanted to.  Not sure what the point was in replying to my review but it lowered the rating even more.Had a pretty severe knee injury in Italy (Cinque Terre) and couldn't get to a doctor for a few days but knew I'd be unable to continue our trip in areas that required any kind of walking - most of Italy.  Because I changed my flight before the doctor confirmed that indeed I shouldn't put weight on my knee & should cancel the rest of my trip, they denied the claim - for less then $250 in change fees.  The small medical bill from the doctor in Florence was paid, but it took several weeks and follow-up phone calls told me just to wait until it was processed.  I gave it two stars because at least they paid the medical bill (under $200).",1
Sevencorners,"I filed a claim towards the end of July, they told me it would be reviewed in 30 days, which it was. I got the confirmation email that it was review and it listed everything I was being paid for and told me that the delivery of my payment would take UP TO 10 business days, which you’d think that it would come maybe a little early or at least on the 10th day but it still has not. I could just be overreacting because it’s the 10th business day but it’s 10pm and obviously won’t be delivered. In my opinion, 10 business days is plenty of time to ship a check, it should be here by now.",2
Sevencorners,"Had an international flight delayed 10 hours in Lisbon come to find that out that our two main suitcases with clothes for a family of four did not make it to Rome, our destination. After living in the same clothes for 48 hours and no help from the airline to locate our two bags, I went back to the airport in hopes they arrived before we departed for a 10-day Mediterranean cruise. Thankfully, our two bags were in the lost luggage area and we would have clothes for the next 10 days. I filed a claim for our two delayed luggage bags that were delayed for over 48 hours. It took 4 months to receive a decision if I would receive the monetary benefit of $500 per bag that I paid for with the purchase of the insurance coverage. I did not receive what the insurance should have covered. I received a total of $100. So, I do not recommend Seven Corners. Not deserving one star.",1
Sevencorners,"Tristan Schilling was the agent I booked my policy through. He was very professional, patient and knowledgeable. The epitome of caring customer service.",5
Sevencorners,Candy was wonderful and very thorough in reviewing my travel insurance purchase and correcting a couple of errors I made on the application form.,5
Sevencorners,"I had a bicycle accident in Portugal and broke my wrist.  I called Seven Corners from the hospital, and they suggested I pay up front (since the costs weren't exorbitant) then submit receipts.  I did exactly that, collecting receipts until the cast came off five weeks later.  I then submitted everything and received the reimbursement checks today, four weeks later.  I definitely will use their insurance again!",5
Sevencorners,Seven Corners has an irrational out clause which let's them avoid paying legitimate claims.Never will use this company again.,1
Sevencorners,"I needed more info on part of my policy, the gal that answered the phone was helpful but needed to check more in depth. She got back promptly & answered what was needed.",5
Sevencorners,"Was able to get information about how to file a claim, however, representative, could have sought to help me with general information about how to file a claim instead of telling me she could not help me without a release from the person I was seeking the info for.  My question did not require any personal or private information, just how soon a claim had to be filed, since in the coverage doc it talks about 20 days and 90 days.  Bottomline, please seek to be as helpful as Seven Corners typically is, before trying to shut someone down and create unnecessary anxiety and work.  In the end, it was fine and she was nice and helpful once we got to what I really needed to know. i.e. ""I can't answer specific questions regarding your mother-in-law's policy without her authorization, but policies provide 90 days from the event date to file a claim.""",4
Sevencorners,"We had few questions about claim form.Customer service representative was patient and friendly, she answered all our questions in details. She knew what she was talking about.",5
Sevencorners,MY FAMILY AND I WERE NOT PAID BACK FOR THE COVID PCR TEST THAT WE TOOK BEFORE TRAVELLING EVEN THOUGH WE HAD COVERAGE FOR COVID. WE GAVE THEM THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION BUT WERE DENIED. NO PROPER EXPLANATION WAS GIVEN TO US WHY WE WERE DENIED COVERAGE. WE NEVER EXTENDED OUR COVERAGE AGAIN WITH THEM.,1
Sevencorners,I need assistance with my certificate number. I’ve been told it’s incorrect and I should ask the seven corners to change it with new ID card.I can’t claim because I’m told my certificate number is incorrect. I don’t understand because I was given this number.Update: I was assisted. Thank you so much!!!!,5
Sevencorners,"I needed to make adjustments to my policy after the initial purchase.I made numerous attempts to contact my agent through emails and voicemails until I finally again made contact, then the issue was quickly resolved, l but I was disappointed in how many times my attempts to contact were ignored",3
Sevencorners,Representative never returned phone calls or responded to emails after the initial cancellation period was over.  It was a relatively large policy - trip cost per person was over US$50K.   I contacted Customer Service directly and have to be transferred a few times to get the right support.   I will never insured with this company again.,2
Sevencorners,"I needed to file a claim and spoke with three reps as I was putting it together.  They were competent and wonderfully kind on every call.  The documentation was complex, and I received detailed instructions and confirmations.  After I filed the claim, there were no follow-up questions or concerns on Seven Corners' part.  In a few weeks, my claim was accepted and the funds sent to my bank.  I was very impressed and would recommend their travel insurance to everyone.  Phillip Forester",5
Sevencorners,"Seven Corners came through for me when I was unexpectedly diagnosed with AL Amyloidosis and was unable to travel to the Galapagos Islands and Ecuador.  They were courteous, helpful, and refunded the cost of the trip according to the travel insurance contract.  I'm very happy with their service!",4
Sevencorners,"Well, this is a good time for me to write one of two reviews.I have used Seven Corners many times before, but I have never put in a claim.  Today I did because my flight from Italy back to the US was outright cancelled after being delayed for six plus hours.  We had to spend another night and had to leave the next morning.  The airline paid for the hotel so I did not add that to my claim.  Only food, taxi transportation and one clothing item because I was cold.The claim was fairly easy to input although I had to send the validating documents separately because it kept deleting them (file was too big which I found odd since it was just a few receipts).  I sent them directly to their customer service email.I chose 4 stars for good phone customer service and some direction on the site that I had difficulty using.What remains to be seen is the ease of getting the few hundred dollars I submitted paid to me.  It was actually roughly the cost of the policy itself.   I am not a fan of and have not had good experiences with insurance companies to date.  I'm hopeful this will be different, and I'll upgrade and provide a review once I see how it goes.  Stay tuned!",4
Sevencorners,I was able to talk to a person right away and not an AI. She was very helpful and pleasant. I would recommend this insurance to anyone.,5
Sevencorners,When looking at travel insurers make sure you only pay attention to reviews where claims were filed. We had a flight cancelled from Atlanta to Asheville NC after we’d been traveling for 28 hours straight from Germany. They rebooked our family of 5 all on separate flights over the course of two separate days including my 8 year old. It wasn’t an option for her to fly alone. There was not a single rental car available in a 30 mile radius for drop off in Asheville so we hired a very expensive Uber. In my claim I made clear that we were not expecting full reimbursement but did expect some kind of relief. Maybe fair market value of a rental car driven 200 miles (even though none were available). They denied our claim because they only cover “local” transportation. How in the world am I supposed to get home from Germany using only local transportation?? I guess they expected us to stay in Atlanta and fly one by one back to Asheville over two days with my 8 and 12 year olds by themselves. I’ll never use this company again and will happily tell anyone who brings up the subject of travel insurance about my experience. Save your money…you may need it for “non-local” transporation.,1
Sevencorners,It did not take long to answer my question.,5
Sevencorners,I highly recommend Seven Corners.  Someone picks up the phone quickly when you call.  Staff are knowledgeable and resolve your concerns.  We had to claim reimbursement for a trip and the process was very smooth and efficient.  Thank you Seven Corners.,5
Sevencorners,"I found Seven Corners responsive, organized, and helpful.  My only problem was that I am not good at dealing with electronic devices, partly because I am 82 and did not grow up with these devices.  I did need a physical copy of the form I needed in order to fill out the application for repayment of the costs of an unexpected medical emergency.  I had to call a couple of times before receiving these forms, but they were sent to me eventually.  However, no one acted impatient with my lack of expertise and finally, we figured out how to print the online version of the form which we had been sent initially.  This is a really good company!! In addition, the agents I spoke with spoke clearly and understandably, without difficult-to-understand foreign accents.",4
Sevencorners,I spoke with Andrea in Customer Service. She was beyond helpful. Very professional and went way beyond what I was asking for.  Complete blessing to Seven Corners to have her working there.,5
Sevencorners,Our connecting flight on AA was cancelled by British Air without telling us.  We could not get a flight out that day and had to spend a night in a hotel.  I sent all the information and bill to Seven Corners and was reimbursed the hotel stay in a reasonable amount of time.,5
Sevencorners,"Obtaining the policy was easy and phone staff was very friendly and helpful. But, unfortunately -- or fortunately -- we didn't have to file a claim, so I have no idea how well Seven Corners does with ease of claims and reimbursement.",4
Sevencorners,Andrea is the customer service person that I spoke with. She was beyond helpful immediately emailed me the forms that I needed and walked me through what I would have to fill out. She went out of her way to make my experience a good one excellent customer service.,5
Sevencorners,"Seven Corners communicated with me from the time before my trip, during and after. It provided me with my documents in emails more than once, so they were accessible and convenient. I appreciated having these communications even though I had downloaded the documents on my phone. It was nice to have them in various locations in case I needed them in a hurry.",5
Sevencorners,"I bought the insurance with every option possible, and when I needed Seven Corners, they just let me down.On my way from San Diego to Costa Rica, I fell in the airplane, before getting to Miami. I hit my head hard and fractured my pelvis and hip.I filed the paperwork on time as required, but had a hard time getting my medical records from the hospital and Rehab.I thought that I would have a special seat arrangement on the plane, and would recoup the money I paid for the hotel in Costa Rica ($2,000+), but SEVEN CORNERS advised me that the policy had expired although I did file the Fit to Fly/accident report on time.The hospital took too long to forward my Medical Records to Seven Corners, and while taking Morphine, etc., you are in no condition to monitor these types of things. In my mind, as long as I filed their forms and the ""Fit to Fly"" form, I thought I was ready to go. Do you see any mentions of Medical Records on the contract?I won't be getting a refund from my Costa Rica Hotel money, nor will have a special seat on the airplane to go back to San Diego. My mobility level requires assistance, and don't know anyone in Miami. I will be released in a couple of days and am in no condition to fly on my own.Read the contract and if it appears to be evasive, BELIEVE ME, their contract was purposely designed to deceive you.",1
Sevencorners,"Re: purchasing policy--Phone rep very knowledgeable, steered me to make change online, stayed on phone as I extended date of policy.  Online experience and site very easy to use",5
Sevencorners,"Our representative was amazing. She was professional and very patient especially dealing with a large group like ours.  Any changes that I needed done, were done with no hesitation.Thank you.",5
Sevencorners,"I had several questions about the claim form and direct, clear answers were given politely and professionally. I liked the call back feature during peak times2RTB22-AOS-125722",5
Sevencorners,"The representative, (Tristan), when we selected our plan was Excellent. He is Very well informed, spoke clearly and explained all completely.Fortunately, we did not have to use your services during our trip as all went well.",5
Sevencorners,Seven Corners is my primary travel insurance provider. Their flexibility and customer service is tremendous. I've used them for many years and have also handled a claim for me perfectly.,5
Sevencorners,Call 2 times today.    Both times representative was helpful.  Have used seven corners before.    Find they are very reliable.,5
Sevencorners,"Troy handled my wife and my travel insurance requests promptly, professionally and we shared some humor....I have been using 7 corners for years as we have traveled to 104 countries, all 7 Continents, circumnavigated Australia, Iceland and traveled around Africa and S America!",5
Sevencorners,Andrea was outstanding in dealing with my question. She was knowledgeable and helped me in finding a solution. Thank you!,5
Sevencorners,"Our return flights from Cairo to the US were cancelled by the airline due to a strike at Munich Airport, so we purchased alternative flights home and submitted a claim for the additional cost, which was modest after net refunds for the cancelled flights.The initial claim was denied "" as the interruption was not triggered due to the strike being a planned event "" Since the strike was NOT planned when we started the trip, let alone when we bought the policy, we appealed this decision.The appeal was also denied, but now for a different reason -  "" a strike must result in cessation of travel services for at least 48 hours of the carrier "". While the strike itself in Munich airport was 24 hours, the earliest flight option offered by the airline was 48 hours later !I did not expect Seven Corners to resort to differing and illogical explanations to avoid reimbursing a reasonable claim.",2
Sevencorners,It took entirely too long for the claim to be processed (49 days); however we were compensated to our satisfaction in the end.,3
Sevencorners,Didn’t have to use it..this time. But had to twice in the past. Both times in Spain. Company was very responsive and fair. Took a little longer during Covid but they came through in covering unexpected expenses related to us catching Covid.,5
Sevencorners,Signing up was easy & quick. I had no claims so i can't speak to that but i definitely felt more at ease knowing i was covered for all unexpected emergencies.,5
Sevencorners,It is nice knowing you have insurance in case anything goes wrong.  The airlines lost one of my suitcases and eventually found it but was glad I had backup if needed.,5
Sevencorners,Good policy options and pricing.  Like to purchase high coverage for medical without covering full cost of trips - like the options Seven Corners provides,5
Sevencorners,Answered the questions and corrected wife's last name. Haven't used any of the features so can't comment on how well the actual coverage is done.,5
Sevencorners,GOOD VALUE for what you get compared to other insurance. Their definitions and documentation was straight forward and when I called their customer service to make changes they were very cooperative and friendly.,5
Sevencorners,"I had a very pleasant and productive experience. The representative i talked to ( i apologize for not remembering his name) was super friendly, engaging, very knowledgeable, and most importantly He addressed all of my issues. So thank you so much for making my day and allowing me to check off one more item from my to do list.",5
Sevencorners,"Seven Corners advertises coverage on their website and pamphlets that sound perfect. Then they sell you a package underwritten by another company. That company applies their rules. The first 5 pages of the insurance packet makes the coverage seem perfect.Then, on page 20, there are fine print details in legalese that exclude anything possible.They will ask for supporting documents, and lead you on for weeks. IF you manage to succeed with filing a claim, they will then bring up fine print and claim you aren't covered for it. So why ask me for all the supporting documents for something that isn't covered? Why waste six weeks of my time?This is racketeering by definition. You are given the illusion of choice, while in actuality they are running a racket. You do not have choice and their product is not what you think you are buying. One big bamboozle.They will send you a form letter ""signed"" by a claims specialist with their phone number at the bottom. The phone number takes you to the main 1-800 line, and they will tell you it is impossible to speak to H****** ******* - despite denying my claim and putting her name on a letter about it. So they either ""gate keep"" or lie as part of the racket. The ""license number"" ""H******"" uses is for the company, Seven Corners. There is no person by that name licensed in the state she claims.They advertise ""X coverage up to $5,000"", and that their medical policies cover more than just medical. Turns out, the extras only apply if someone died. That was on page 20 of the packet in legalese. Apparently I picked the wrong option for my trip. I have college degrees. This company, and their agents, are completely in violation of any fiduciary duty. So, what on my side could potentially even be a clerical error; is to them my mistake and I've lost all chance at a claim.I missed days in Europe, flights, hotels, tours, etc, then was dumped in Europe for a week without a bag or belongings, and now I'm SOL.",1
Sevencorners,"Easy to purchase coverage. Did not need to use it, so no experience there but would use again based on how easy it was to purchase coverage.",5
Sevencorners,"They understood that we had extended our trip, and they let us buy the insurance we needed going forward.  We purchased the insurance about 3 weeks before the extended part of our trip started.",5

Sevencorners,No review text found,5
Sevencorners,Travel insurance is something you hope you never need. We didn't need ours but it was good to know it was there. We had about 20k tied up. 7 corners was in constant contact with us from about 7 days out until the vacation was over. Good to know they were there.,5
Sevencorners,Well we had no issues but had peace of mind knowing if something did happen we were covered,5
Sevencorners,I had an issue with the policy set up when I missed a letter off my email.Seven Corners staff rectified the issue very efficiently.,5
Sevencorners,"Great customer service. Thank goodness we didn’t need to use the insurance however when I called with questions I received answers immediately from a caring, helpful employee!",5
Sevencorners,"I strongly urge you to steer clear of this company. I had trip insurance for a trip to Maui that we had to cancel due to the wildfires. I managed to cancel and receive refunds from every entity, including the airline, VRBO rental, rental damage insurance, car rental, every excursion/activity we had planned and prepaid, etc. You get the idea. However, Seven Corners refused to cancel our trip insurance although they would have had to pay me thousands of dollars for the legitimate trip cancellation as I had paid for an ""any reason"" cancellation. However, under the circumstances, each entity gave me a 100% refund although we were outside the cancellation time for the airline and condo rental, which was the significant portion of what the loss would have been. It is outrageous that Seven Corners lacked empathy and disallowed me to cancel the policy under this situation. For full disclosure, they did offer to ""suspend"" the insurance to allow me to apply it WITHIN 1 YEAR, in case we reschedule out trip. I tried to explain that does me no good since our plans were in West Maui, specifically in Lahaina, which will NOT be rebuilt within a year. I trust they will reply to this review with something about the terms of the policy not allowing a cancellation, but I remind everyone reading this that Delta Airlines and VRBO could have invoked their non-cancellation terms also and forced me into a credit situation. However, those companies showed empathy for an elderly couple who had saved for a bucket list trip to Maui to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary. Shame on Seven Corners.",1
Sevencorners,Easy to communicate with. Each time all transactions have been completed in a fast manner. Every person I have interacted with has been very nice and professional.,5

I have dutifully submitted all the required documentation, but they seem to have made no effort to respond or address my concerns. Their lack of communication and unresponsiveness have left me frustrated and anxious about the status of my claim.I have tried reaching out to them via email and phone calls numerous times, but my attempts have been met with silence. It is disheartening to see such a lack of concern for their customers, especially when they are obligated to provide the services they have promised.As a last resort, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) in the hopes that it would prompt a response from Seven Corner Insurance Company. However, even the BBB complaint has not elicited any reply from the company. My research on the BBB website has further revealed that my experience is not an isolated incident, as there are other customers facing similar issues with the company. It is distressing to see Seven Corner listed as a company with multiple complaints and no resolution, despite their claims of being the best insurance company, as highlighted on their website with a Forbes award in 2023.I firmly believe that consumers should be protected from such fraudulent practices, and it is imperative that authorities step in to safeguard our rights as consumers. Misleading promises and lack of accountability from insurance companies can have severe consequences for individuals who rely on their services to protect themselves and their families.I kindly request your intervention in this matter and urge you to investigate the actions of Seven Corner Insurance Company thoroughly. They should be held accountable for their misleading practices, lack of responsiveness, and failure to fulfill their obligations to their customers, as outlined in their policy agreements.MOST ANNOYING THAT YOU WILL FIND THE COMPANY WILL RESPOND TO ANY REVIEW LIKE(I will put in an escalation request to look into your claims. Our goal is for the Escalation Team to contact you within 10 business days (Monday - Friday).) THAT MSGS I GOT 2 MONTHS AGO ON GOOGLE REVIEW then you will find a new 3 or 4 Positive 5stars reviews after each negative Reviews what magic in all these company reviews 😂",1

Sevencorners,the people at your company are very helpful and courteous,5
Sevencorners,"Requesting a refund was very straightforward. However, it did seem like there was a duplication of document requests.  Nonetheless, I was very satisfied with the process and outcome.",5
Sevencorners,"We had originally booked our trip to Peru in 2020. As everyone knows that year COVID stalled everyone's travel plans. So we re-booked for 2021, travel was still iffy, so then rebooked again for 2022, where travel was still concerning. We FINALLY went on our trip to Peru July 2023. Seven Corners worked with us, and was able to use the travel insurance we purchased back in in early 2020 and transfer it for 2023. As I had to do was contact them with our updated travel plans. I did not need to purchase new travel insurance due to change of date plans.",5
Sevencorners,"Thankfully I didn't need to use the coverage, but it was easy to sign up for, all the documents and info were easy to understand and print off to take with me on my trip.",5
Sevencorners,"Excellent customer service so far. We have always gotten trip insurance but never had to use it until this past trip. Unfortunately, due to weather delays we were stuck in NY for 2 extra days that was not expected. This is the first time I've ever had to make a claim and so far so good. The customer service rep was super helpful and I am so glad that I chose Seven Corners for my insurance needs!",5
Sevencorners,No need for medical attention the five months in Vienna.,5
Sevencorners,"The materials explaining what the insurance did/did not cover were clear and easy to read, and I determined it provided the best coverage for the price. Also purchasing was super easy and smooth. Fortunately I didn’t have to use it but it also seemed like there were many options for reaching someone in case of emergency.",5
Sevencorners,"Completion of purchasing in stages of payment of actual costs is wonderful.  Deposit, final payment of cruise/tour, flights, transportation, etc.",5
Sevencorners,The representatives were courteous and helpful  in answering my questions and getting to me the necessary forms and explaining the required information I would need  to file my claim.,5
Sevencorners,No help was provided by the representative. The customer service line was not working due off-hours even though it was supposed to 24/7. They claim more than they provide.,1
Sevencorners,Speaking personally to an English-speaking representative who was able to answer my questions and facilitate the claim process.,5
Sevencorners,I didn't need to use the insurance so I can't speak to how well it works. The brochures and other material appeared clear and self-explanatory. It did take a while to register (done by the organization sponsoring my overseas stint). They said there was some complication particular to the state I am from (New York). So you may want to register early to be sure you are covered from day one of your travel.,4
Sevencorners,I had a good experience with the handling of my claim when travel was delayed for my tour to Italy. The compensation was quick and fair.,5
Sevencorners,Getting the insurance was easy and quick.  I didn’t have to use it thank goodness.,5
Sevencorners,"We submitted both medical and trip delay claims with Seven Corners while we were traveling abroad. Their agents are professional, informative, and kind. Both claims were fully covered and the process was facilitated with ease. The premium cost is very reasonable for the scope of coverage offered. We felt very secure traveling with Seven Corners' coverage plan, and I would gladly use their services again in the future. I travel often, both with and without additional travel insurance coverage, and after using Seven Corners, I can confidently recommend their services to anyone traveling abroad.",5

Sevencorners,Sister died over in Chile on July 4th 2022 and we are still have a hard time being reimbursed from Five Corners. You do not respond to our emails and when you do it's to say that you don't have the paperwork which we have sent FOUR times. This has been an extremely difficult time for us and you have made it even move so. I would NOT recommend you at all and simply say that this company feels very much like a scam. Especially since we were FORCED to acquired your policy to enter Chile.,1
Sevencorners,Nathan Nowacki did a great job walking me through how to submit a claim and answer all my questions.,5
Sevencorners,"I just completed a glorious trip -- riding horses in the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming. While I had no need to file a claim, having this policy gave me peace of mind --especially when someone else on the trip had an accident! Will definitely purchase a policy in the future.",5
Sevencorners,"I was very disappointed that I did not receive a complete refund of my minimal expense. It is very frustrating to pay so much for insurance. Then, when you actually need help and submit a claim, the company finds every excuse not to fulfill their obligation.Cert#1994655DF244",3
Sevencorners,"Fortunately I have never had to use the insurance I have gotten through Seven Corners, but I continue to be impressed with help I get when I call them for I travel insurance and advice.  I was recommended to them several years ago and have recommended SC myself.   It is just so seamless",5
Sevencorners,Customer focused - easy to deal with and answered all questions. Sent documentation promptly and followed up as necessary.,5
Sevencorners,"After researching several companies and having used others for past overseas trips, I decided to purchase a ""Cancel for Any Reason"" policy with Seven Corners for my most recent trip to the UK.  They had the most reasonable prices and easy to understand conditions.  I also appreciated how I can purchase an initial smaller amount and then as I continue to pay the final payments on my trip, I was able to increase coverage.  I did that by calling and Seven Corners representative was extremely helpful.  Everything was easy to understand.  I will definitely use them again.",5
Sevencorners,"We traveled to Croatia in October 22 and had to cut our trip short after self testing 3 times for COVID. With no rooms left at hotel to stay in place and travel with the group no longer an option our travel agent got us a flight to return home. We immediately filed a claim and were told to expect to hear within 90 days. After 90 days and multiple calls/delays we were told the claim would be escalated. After approximately 110 days we filed a complaint with our state insurance commission. After hearing from the commissioner 7 Corners contacted our travel agent who was asked who made the decision to terminate our travels. She indicated she had due to the lack of medical help available. The result was a quick response denying our claim, indicating we did not get an in-country medical diagnosis prior to leaving. At that time all special COVID testing sites both in the city and at the airport had been shut down. We immediately contacted our Primary Physicians once returning and quarantined. 7 Corners then pointed to the policy's clause that a medical professional diagnosis was required prior to leaving our trip. Bottom line: 120 days later, no one at 7 Corners would direct us to a supervisor, claim denied after many efforts to speak to someone about the claim and delays only to get a perfunctory denial. We do not feel that 7 Corners ever gave our claim a serious review and found a clause to cancel after hearing from the Insurance Commissioner. Per their policy, they had the right to deny but did not require 120 days and the run around, delays and no consideration of the COVID circumstances.I am adding the following as an edit since you offered no “reply” option,My post was not about time to getting an answer. It was about the failure to speak forthrightly and the denial during the COVID period when norms were severely impacted, including the availability of medical services while nearly everyone had access to self testing and instructions to quarantine unless symptoms were severe.You reply is as insulting as our experience attempting to get some consideration for our loss while insured by 7 Corners.Allow me to make a specific ask. I would appreciate your review of our claim and consideration be given to at least covering our flight cost to return home.",1
Sevencorners,Customer Service actually was helpful,5
Sevencorners,Submitted claim never heard back from you,1
Sevencorners,"Unfortunately, sometimes unexpected things come up and you aren't able to go on your trip. In our case, our child was hospitalized right before the departure date and was unable to go on her trip. Fortunately, we were reimbursed, in full, by Seven Corners Insurance. It was very easy to file a claim and I was paid very quickly. I highly recommend this insurance for any trip!",5
Sevencorners,"Explained the difference between “travel” insurance and medical travel insurance, which is what we wanted and needed to purchase. Staff was great and support and updates and notices were great. Best of all we did not use to the medical evacuation insurance.",5
Sevencorners,"It has been a year since we missed a flight that was starting our travel to French Polynesia secondary to weather AND mechanical issues.  Had to reschedule travel for the next day and paid for double hotel nights first and second night.  I have sent copius records and information in order to get reimbursed for these nights.  Why in the world would I buy trip insurance if this type of experience was not covered by trip insurance?  I have now gotten two rejections saying they will not reimburse me.  This is absolutely ludicrous.  I spoke with an agent after the first rejection and he said that if they reject the second time that he, personally, would put in for an appeal.  Do not support this greedy, lame company.  I will tell all people to never get trip insurance from Seven Corners.",1
Sevencorners,Coverage questions answered were very helpful in a call made to the California office .,5
Sevencorners,It was very easy to compare insurance coverages through Forbes Advisers. Seven Corners process is simple and quick. I also liked the etailed descriptions of the coverage.DeAwna Bailey was very helpful and is very knowledgeable. She responded promptly to my questions.,5
Sevencorners,Very easy to contact my sales representative. She is very knowledgeable about the Best insurance selection for my needs. The coverage options were easy to understand and very well priced.,5
Sevencorners,"I had no issues with my trip, however, I was pleased with the interactions that I had with the agent whom I purchased the insurance from. I will definitely utilize Seven Corners for travel in the future. This is my first time using Seven Corners and I have recommended it to other friends.",5
Sevencorners,"First time users of Seven Corners and everything went smoothly. The trip was fine, so we didn’t have to file a claim, but we were comforted by the professionalism and clear communication from Seven Corners. Two friends in the insurance business, and one customer of Seven Corners recommended the company, and I believe we made the right choice. I’ll definitely be using them again.",5

Sevencorners,I contacted customer service more than one and each time the person I dealt with was extremely pleasant and was able to answer my thoroughly.I have used another company in the past but will be using Seven Corners in the future.,5
Sevencorners,The site made it easy to choose what insurance to buy and gave helpful details about coverage. We got online ID cards to print and carry so didn't have to wait for them in the mail. One suggestion would be to make the print on the cards larger and easier to read. We didn't need to file any claims so have no feedback on that.,4
Sevencorners,"A scam. A toothache is not covered because it's not a consequence of an injury. A stomachache is covered but apparently your mouth is not part of your body. Horrible experience. Run away!!!!Update:I did send an email to care at sevencorners.com. The answer was, among other things: ""As outlined above, for a Sickness to be covered, it must be as a result of an illness or disease of the body. The mouth is not considered a part of the body. It is part of your digestive system.",1
Sevencorners,Great customer service over the phone!,5
Sevencorners,"I filled up all the forms and uploaded thru Seven Corners website. Then I received an email with more forms to be filled up as well as more documentation to be sent.Besides, the timing to be reimbursed is too long. I have paid all the expenses with my credit card during my trip in April/May 2023 , the billing has being paid and no money from the insurance received yet.Now I have to send them my travel ticket that I trew away. More work to be done .I am going to travel abroad again for 30 days next November. I am really thing about those issues.regardsMaria Henderson",3

Sevencorners,"Heather Kleinschmidt was very knowledgeable, professional and responsive.  Outstanding expertise and pleasant to deal withYou should look to promote and advance her! She answered all my questions honestly and with an obvious command of your terms and conditions.  She gave us peace of mind as we planned our family vacation to Greece, celebrating our first grandson’s arrival and my and my wife’s retirement",5
Sevencorners,Great service and solved my issue very Quickly,5
Sevencorners,"Best way to explain this company is from another comment i found elsewhere about them…..“deceptive business practices and hidden Clauses everywhere! Seven Corners deliberately misleads customers, providing false information on their website and through their agents. They bury critical details, leaving you blindsided by unexpected exclusions and limitations when you need help”I purchased through EF. Had to cancel for lost income / job loss…. They said I didn’t qualify because my job was not W2. Even though I was on a professional platform for 3+ years and taken off due to no fault of my own. I had paper trails and tax returns and proof. Furthermore be careful they also don’t tell you, you have to have worked at your job for 1+ year. So their job loss coverage is only for very specific individuals.",1
Sevencorners,"Thankfully, I did not have to use this insurance.  I was, however, totally impressed with the follow up before I left.  This is the only company that ever did that for me.",5

Sevencorners,We had to cancel a cruise several months before it was to take place. We have submitted at least 3 times information to get my cousin Anne Arnold Stones trip insurance to be funded. We have both submitted anything requested. I am undergoing cancer treatment since February. This has added undo stress to an already stressed 74 year old female. I’m a NICE Karen but this experience has been far from ideal. Every time Anne or I call we get a DIFFERENT PERSON! It seems like it would be beneficial if each Claim was assigned a person or team to deal with the person/persons submitting the claim. Please do something to restore my faith in SEVENCORNERS!,1

If you happen to experience any sort of interruption on your trip, you will not be reimbursed a cancellation fee by Seven Corners. I just got my appeal denied because I’m pregnant. They told me I had to have complications while traveling on my due date in order to be reimbursed. I booked my trip prior to Covid-19 and they used the restrictions to make money off travelers. Go Ahead Tours and Seven Corners are both fraudulent companies. They delete comments and hide the horrible reviews they get to cover up their wrongful doings.Please do your research before you commit to any company.",1

Sevencorners,It was easy to get a quote online and speak to a live agent when I needed to add a country on my recent trip. What I like best is the summary letter of the benefits of my plan. It made it easy when the checkin counter staff asked for my travel insurance. I just presented it instead of going through many pages on my recent trip to Dubai.,5
Sevencorners,While I didn’t have to use it I was confident knowing it was there if I needed it. My son travels extensively and constantly and this s his go-to company.,5
Sevencorners,"Our claim was denied. Elimination of scheduled airline route was apparently a ""foreseeable event"" under our policy. This was certainly a trip interruption.  We missed our connecting flight (next one was full). We forfeited pre-paid expenses and incurred additional ones to reach our destination and rejoin our trip. This policy is misleading.  We will not use this service again.",1
Sevencorners,I was satisfied with the affordable cost of the insurance and I liked the reminders of my coverage before I left on my trip.,5
Sevencorners,I had a great experience with Seven Corners because of the customer rep that provided my insurance.  He was congenial and helpful and explained everything to me so that I was able to purchase the correct insurance coverage for me.  I didn't need to use the insurance so I can't provide an opinion on the things that really would have mattered had I needed to file a claim.,5
Sevencorners,"It is not a specific plan through United. So, there is no set benefit payout contract between them and the doctors. It is literally at their discretion to pay a claim. You will go be up before seeing the payout of a claim. They muddy up the waters and reject them. Cannot get to the bottom.",1
Sevencorners,"Terms of policy not clearly spelled out.  Turns out that the ""missed connection"" benefit only applies to the start of your trip and not your return segments.  On your return there is only a ""trip delay"" benefit.  This scant reimbursement of $150/person is supposed to cover hotel, transport and meals.  Doesn't seem worth the paperwork and headache.",2
Sevencorners,Don't do business with these awful people. My teenager signed up to go to Europe and was diagnosed with Narcolepsy and other mental health issues. We pulled the plug on the trip because we thought it IRRESPONSIBLE to send a 16 Y.O with mental health issues to Europe. We bought the insurance and our $3000 will not be refunded because mental health is not  covered.Here's what they really do.My case has been ongoing for 5 months. The 1st 2 months of my claim I couldn't get a person on the phone. Keep in mind every time you call you speak to a different person. And no 2 reps will tell you the same information. AND THERE IS ALWAYS A NEW RINKLE. So even though a rep just told you to do XYZ to submit a claim when you call back it'll be something different.  And they use this tired game of cat and mouse to wear people down so they don't have to pay your claim. Notice people with 5 star service had no problems. Only because they didn't have to cancel their trip. Avoid these criminals at all cost..,1
Sevencorners,"We have been insuring our travels with Seven Corners for the past seven years.  Our trips had to be canceled twice- the first time because of the start of COVID and the second time because of my husband's passing.

Sevencorners,"Fortunately, we did not have to make a claim.  The initial meeting (by telephone) with Seven Corners was easy and the terms were easy to understand.

I had an unexpected urgent need for medical attention while overseas.  Filing for reimbursement of the expenses, once I got back, was time-consuming but worthwhile - Seven Corners reimbursed the entire cost not covered by my normal medical insurance.

Sevencorners,"I had purchased travel insurance through Seven Corners for my daughter EF Tours Trip to Europe this summer. The coverage, as presented indicated that if there is a loss of job and we had to cancel the trip, the pre-paid expenses would be covered. I did unfortunately lose my job and submitted the claim with the requisite information showing evidence of loss of job. I had also called the EF Tours agents and they had indicated on three occasions that I would be covered. However Seven Corners denied the claim indicating that I had not held the job for more than 1 year. This was not indicated anywhere at the time of marketing or on the verbal guidance from EF Tours. In addition to experiencing the stress of a loss of job, I am now out of pocket over $2,700 and my daughter cannot go. I called EF Tours again to show to me where this verbiage was indicated - they committed to sharing that information but it was not presented.",1
Sevencorners,"Please do not purchase this insurance as they are terrible. My sister has been purchasing Seven Corners for several years and when I was going to visit her in Chile, I got a policy. While in Chile, my sister got sick and passed away while abroad. I was the point person with Seven Corners and almost a year later, we have not been reimbursed for hospital, funeral or the daily fee for hospital stay/incidentals ($100/10 days). Prior to her death, we were working them on a medical evacuation and despite sending ALL the required documents, they never arranged for the medical evacuation and she eventually passed away. In addition, they have refused to pay for her hospital stay. All of my family purchased this policy and they were of no HELP. I have had to get an attorney to get reimbursed. I also plan to contact the Better Business Bureau because they are a scam and no one should spend $400+ for any of their policies.",1

Sevencorners,Glad we didn’t need the insurance but not sure I would spend that much again.,4
Sevencorners,"When choosing an insurance company, Seven Corners provided excellent phone communication and was easy to reach. My questions were thoroughly and promptly answered. They provided the most comprehensive insurance plan for the best price. Fortunately, I did not have to make a claim, so I can provide no information on that aspect of the service.",5
Sevencorners,A very bitter experience ! I put money in Educational Tour account and when i cancelled the trip they sent me to you to pay me the money. You finally told me i have no reimbursement. The whole thing is very disturbing.,1
Sevencorners,"I called Seven Corners to credit a previous policy I purchased (for a trip that got cancelled), towards my current trip. They were all extremely polite, friendly and helpful. I was able to credit my trip plus take out new policies for the rest of my family in one smooth phone call that took under 20 minutes. Thank you!",5
Sevencorners,"I first used Seven Corners for a trip to Italy in 2020. When my bag was stolen, they reimbursed me no questions asked. I was grateful for their quick response and reimbursement. Since that time, I have used them for every major trip and trust them with my travels!",5
Sevencorners,My call was answered quickly and the representative answered  all my questions.,5
Sevencorners,As I mentioned before - don’t waste your money on their insurance services … when you need the help this company has a policy that prevents you from receiving the money owed to you & your family. A big scam.,1

Sevencorners,"Used Seven Corners a handful of times and finally had to file a claim for medical treatment that amounted to a few hundred dollars.Filed the claim, sent in all the necessary documentation and was told to wait 90 days. After well over 90 days, I contact them again for the status of the claim.They apologized for the delay and I was told they would escalate my claim and have it resolved quickly.And here's where the problems start. After already having sent in everything necessary, which they acknowledged, they asked for even more documentation. Things you would never receive traveling through less developed countries, let alone have access to 5 months later.So they basically pull a ""victory by attrition"" scam on you. And if that's what they do to a repeat customer for a sub-$1000 claim, I can only imagine how difficult they make it for people that have some major happen.Seven Corners, keep your claim money and in the future I'll spend my money elsewhere. Actually, I already have.",1

Sevencorners,"Purchased “cancel for any reason” insurance on a themed cruise. Unfortunately, we did have to cancel. It took about 3 months, but our claim was paid. I did check in for status updates every month.",4
Sevencorners,Great phone service and claim settlement!,5
Sevencorners,Seven Corners delivered the travel insurance coverage I requested at a fair price and continued communication and follow up regularly right up to our trip and also when we arrived back home. Felt we had a partner walking beside us the entire time!,5
Sevencorners,At first there was trouble finding the right policy because I am certain the customer service folks are trying to sell policies with more coverage…so I had to call several times and insist that I only wanted the basic one. After this hurdle it was smooth sailing.,5

Sevencorners,Updating my policy was quick and easy with the help of an advisor.,5
Sevencorners,"I knew I needed a cancel for any reason clause for my trip. Seven Corners had a great option for this. I filed my claim once I knew we had to cancel in Feb. The process was easy, the customer service agent walked me through the process.  It did take around 90 days to get the claim processed but they paid no questions asked.",5
Sevencorners,I gave a 5 star rating because the information I received prior to leaving was clear and concise.  I did not have to use the services but I knew exactly what to do in case the need arose.,5

Sevencorners,Very efficient operator who had our renewal information. Price was the kept the same as last year so much appreciated.,5
Sevencorners,I had no issues at all with your service. Everything went smooth. Thank you.,5
Sevencorners,"Nothing went wrong but I felt prepared. The customer service prior to travel was great, but the one time I called while traveling, I wish the agent had known more. They were not able to confidently answer my question and seemed to just read information directly from my policy before telling me how I could enter a claim online. Not too helpful, but luckily a claim wasn't necessary.",3
Sevencorners,Agent was knowledgeable and very curious.,5
Sevencorners,Fortunately I had no need for using the insurance. I did have a dress that got lost but am not sure if that'd be covered. Will contact my agent to see. The purchase process was seamless and our agent was very helpful.,5
Sevencorners,"I'm a Seven Corners client for life. Why? Because though I didn't encounter any problems while traveling recently, I had peace of mind because on a previous jaunt I got sick and Seven Corners came through for me with flying colors. Support while recuperating overseas, easy accessibility for advice, a kept-every-promise standard while providing reimbursement--this company acted with integrity and compassion. I won't use any other travel insurance provider.",5

Sevencorners,I spoke to a very helpful representative who answered several questions regarding filing a claim.,5
Sevencorners,Just knowing that the insurance was there,5
Sevencorners,"I judge an insurance company based on how they handle claims, and this company handles them very poorly. Poor communication, no updates by email or phone, even when they were needing more from me, they waited until I called to find out what was going on. Four months later and it looks like they’ve paid out far less than expected, while the health companies are hounding me to find out what’s going on. The coverage itself, now that I understand it, is incredibly inadequate: I had to make two (quick) trips to ER for xrays, and they are covering less than $1000 of my $6000 bill.When time came to extend coverage, I chose a different company with much better coverage so that, if anything happens in the future, the bills are fully paid.Highly recommend you think twice and look closely before selecting this dreadful provider.",1
Sevencorners,"We thankfully didn't need to actually use the insurance, so I can't comment on that process.  However I was appreciative that an agent contacted me to ensure I had the correct coverage that I wanted.  The process was very simple and I am using this company again for another upcoming trip.",5
Sevencorners,"Although I had travel insurance, when my flight got cancelled and I had to re-book it for a different one, Seven Corners refused to reimbursed me for the flight giving me excuses. So I ended up paying for the flight twice. Very disappointing. Customer service is nice, but they don't pay my bills.",1
Sevencorners,"Delay Delay Delay, asking for documents when already sent. Don't waste your time with this company. Called and always same response, under review. Very simple claim, they are as worse as the insurance companies in Florida. Probably need a lawyer to get your claim money",1
Sevencorners,"Other with signing up via the website with no flaw, we don’t have much experience",4
Sevencorners,"I shopped for plans at many companies and found the Seven Corners Roundup Choice to be the best for me. Seven Corners was great about answering the phone promptly and answering my questions clearly and directly. You have to read the fine print on contracts to really understand the pros and cons, and they helped with interpretation of the rules. Also, they provided me with everything I needed before the trip.We ended up having to file a claim, and they were helpful with that. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is that they were backed up on processing claims (due to Covid), and it took almost two months to get my refund. However, they were up front about the delay, and sent periodic emails assuring me that I wasn't forgotten.",4
Sevencorners,Seven Corners is outstanding with their communication to customers.  They provide instructions that are easy to understand in the event of needing assistance during your travels.  This made me feel confident that I would have the coverage I purchased.  Their pricing is competitive and affordable.  I appreciate their professionalism. Thank you Seven Corners!

Sevencorners,"I purchased Seven Corners Travel insurance for a recent trip to Germany, as I've done before.  This time I experienced flight delays and flight cancellations with little assistance from the airlines to reschedule.  Upon my return, 2 days later than was scheduled, I filed a claim for expenses incurred due to my delays and Seven Corners processed my claim promptly!  I would highly recommend for your protection to secure travel insurance from this reputable and well-established company the next time you travel - for minimal cost it provides great peace of mind!",5

No action for 2 months.  We called and that person said they still couldn't see the documents.  We sent them to another email address.  2 months later they still don't seem to be processing a completely valid claim (daughter got ill and spend the night in the ER when we should have been boarding a flight.)  We have provided everything asked for in triplicate (complete with doctors notes, medical records, itineraries, receipts, credit card statements, etc.)  and still haven't received a thing.  I truly think they just want you to give up.",1
Sevencorners,My recent inquiry was handled very well.  I appreciated the prompt responses.,5

Sevencorners,cannot really say how my experience would have been as I never (thank goodness) needed to file a claimwhile traveling.thank you tho.,3
Sevencorners,I feel the money belongs to the customers and should be able to request for a refund if they are no longer able to attend the trip without hesitation or need of approval.,3
Sevencorners,"NEVER AGAIN! My, overall, experience that I had with this company was exhausting. It took over 5 months to get my claim processed. I had to make numerous phone calls. Also, they did not pay the claim at the correct amount, but it is not worth spending more time on it.",1
Sevencorners,"Never had to use it but was great to know it was there. Very intuitive and clear process. Great communication on your coverage, easy to use app, easy to buy quote, and very good price. Will definitely use again for future trips",5
Sevencorners,All good...excellent coverage at a fair price.,5
Sevencorners,Thankfully I did not have a claim but the people I dealt with were polite and knowledgeable. And the company followed up before I was leaving on vacation as well as when I returned.,5
Sevencorners,"Luggage was left behind by airline, and was delivered to hotel in 2 days. Was told by the girl from insurance company that I will get $100 a day for each day I don’t have my luggage as long as I have airline docs to prove it which I have. Now they telling me when I’m ready to file the claim that I need receipts for the extra purchases I need to buy, which I was not told that on the call so did not save any receipts and purchase was make by euros so no credit card prove either. Therefore my negative review because was not informed appropriately.",1

I have never placed a claim before, so I never knew if it was a waste of money.On a recent trip to Guatemala, I put on over 100 miles macheting our way thru the jungle. unfortunately, I had a medical issue and went to a doctor down there. Much to my delight 7 Corners fully covered the bill. Now I'm a believer!",5
Sevencorners,"The agent was respectful, patient, concise.",5
Sevencorners,"I booked a trip, I bought two travel policies. One for a friend that lives in a different state (hence the different policy), and one for my husband and I. Our friend got cancer.

The trip has since come and gone and we have yet to be reimbursed.",1
Sevencorners,"I chose Seven Corners for travel insurance for a reserved trip based on internet research and reviews. Due to political unrest in several countries in our itinerary, we decided to cancel our trip. Seven Corners was empathic to our safety concerns and was willing to hold our policy for 24 months beyond our original policy date to use when we felt we could safely travel to our preferred destination.",5
Sevencorners,"I am not sure who the nice lady was, but she kindly extended my policy from 2020 to 2023 due to covid. She didn't have to.. aI will be using Seven Corners again.",5

Sevencorners,"Nice attitude, welcoming approach",5
Sevencorners,"DO NOT USE SEVEN CORNERS Such a scam operation... Bought the best policy, with several safeguards, including ""cancel and delay for any reason"" benefits, yet amazingly, when we had to make a claim, that it was denied by ridiculous criteria that needed to be met or else they would deny. They make these policies nearly impossible to use; that's the problem. What's the point of a policy that is impossible to use if you need it? Plus it took 10 weeks to get an answer. Stay far away from this company. Just read the reviews if you don't believe me.",1

Sevencorners,"Another Update to your response:Wish there was a way to make a direct reply on this site. But since there apparently isn’t, here goes:No, I don’t need to file an appeal. Once again, I repeat, I received payment in full but only after waiting 3.5 months and filing official complaints that got Seven Corners’ attention finally.  And the adjuster implying I was trying to get a double refund, because she hadn’t bothered to read the attached documentation or done the Math.Update:  After waiting 3.5 months, spending hours annd hours of my time following up and resending the same old documents, and then filing a complaint with BBB and Zerocomplaint Squaremouth, I received full payment.  But they also said that I tried to collect payment when I had received a refund from the airline. I did receive a refund but I was still short $50, and that was just a small part of my claim. They do not take the time and trouble to read all the documentation.Those people who have given Seven Corners a great rating have not filed claims. That’s a whole other experience 🤦‍♀️. I would never use them again. I had actually purchased the insurance with Squaremouth. I had no idea they were a broker and they placed the policy with Seven Corners, knowing full well the major servicing issues that Seven Corners has for well over a year now. So I will never buy insurance with Squaremouth again either.",1
Sevencorners,"Beware lack of transparency and obscure terminology used regarding Future cruise credits not qualifying, claiming they do not cover any cruise credits that were applied yet future cruise credits equal the same value as payments representing the same voyage booking value.

I know that if something would have happened, Troy would take care of us. Thank you Seven Corners! We will be using you again in October!",5

Sevencorners,"Still waiting for a payment 4+ months after filing claim. They're not even sending regular updates any more.  I suppose they can use the excuse that they needed my cc statements and not just paid invoices, but they didn't ASK for them until 2+ months into it, which leads me to recommend that some first-tier person check claims upon receipt to see if something is missing, or in this case -- PUT ON THE CLAIM FORM to include CC statements.  (Perhaps it's something used to justify stretching out the claim response.)  It's a large amount ($20K), and I know they've got staffing issues.    I just hope this isn't being dragged out because they're strapped for cash.  And if that's the case -- that their liabilities are covered in case of a bankruptcy.  Maybe this is standard for travel insurance companies, but if this goes on much longer, I'm going to write Forbes, which is where I heard about them in the first place.  (And this is NOT the only trip I've insured with them.)UPDATE:   It has been almost 5 months since I filed my claim and sent them multiples pages of hospital discharge notes for the heart attack that caused me to cancel my trip as well as paid invoices -- every documentation that they asked for on the claim form.  It has been about 2 mos. since they got around to asking me for credit card statements, which I promptly provided.   I wouldn't have bothered to update this except Trustpilot sent me an email, which led to me reading other reviews on the company on their site.   Interestingly enough -- everyone seems to love them ... EXCEPT for the people who file a claim.    Lots of positive reviews about how easy it is to buy a policy ... and no good reviews on claim experience.",3

My claim was somehow denied, stating the reason as my flight was not delayed for more than 6 consecutive hours. In reality, my departure flight was canceled and rebooked over 24 hours later AND my return flight was also canceled and rebooked 8 hours later. Don't waste your money on this scam insurance.",1

Sevencorners,"Took out insurance for a trip, was hit by a snow storm at the start of our trip and the airline changed our flight and we experienced delays along the way. They are refusing to pay out because we did not notify them that we were starting our trip earlier to get out of the snow storm - they admitted that their documentation states nothing about having to notify them and by when. After throwing their semantics back at them, they added me to a ""Customer Block List"" so I was not able to email them. DO NOT use this insurance, they basically cover nothing. I had more luck with JP Morgan Chase Sapphire Card insurance and the airline.",1
Sevencorners,"This has been the most disappointing, misleading insurance plan I have ever seen.I had a medical emergency when I was traveling abroad in Italy, which should have been covered given the terms of the Seven Corners Policy. However, they have refused to pay my claim and as a result, my medical emergency had to be taken out of pocket (150 EUR). It has been 8 months since I have submitted my claim, and I have to constantly call or follow up via email to get any response whatsoever. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this company or insurance policy to anyone looking to travel outside of the United States as they WILL NOT approve any claims, even if the claim falls well within the limitations of their policy. I would give 0 stars if possible because the customer service teams have been completely inaccessible or unwilling to assist me with my medical claim rejection.",1

My guess is that squaremouth is lying to you because there’s no way it would have anything above one star. And I know I only got Covid, but they broke into my luggage and ignored my claims and kept saying that I did not have enough proof that I owned these things and then when I sent the proof, they just sent me a boiler plate denial letter.",1

If you ever need to use your travel insurance, it's a horrible experience.I usually don't buy travel insurance but with Covid and this was our first International trip post-pandemic, I figured it might be a good idea. Seven Corners had solid reviews at the time. I ended up getting sick on our trip (non-Covid) and the cost was about $3500 in medical. I filed the claim immediately upon our return in July 2022. It took them 8 months to finally review and pay the claim!!! And this included me calling and emailing them every few weeks and escalating the claim.I can not recommend using them because of how long it takes them to process a claim.",1
Sevencorners,"Awful, uncaring when claims are submitted, they give you excuses to not refund the money even after sending all the documents. I am writing on my mother's behalf, she traveled overseas for a short emergency trip, and had to be rushed to the hospital where after a minor surgery she had a stroke, she insisted in returning to the States after only three days so as not to incurred in more financial distress, once here we submitted the claim to seven corners and that was 4 months ago, we submitted all the documents, my mother has had another stroke due to the stress this is causing her, having to pay the money she had to borrow to pay while being in the hospital overseas, she has not been able to go back to work, and we still have not had a refund even though we have submitted  everything they asked. They are terrible.",1
Sevencorners,Hello! I don't normally leave reviews but I had an actual emergency when I was travelling in Aruba where my health was severely compromised (broken leg).

Sevencorners,"Had no issues, no concerns -- no claims made!",5
Sevencorners,"Worst travel company out there!!!  We went on a trip in May 2022 and had a trip interruption. We filed a claim in June 2022 and did not hear from them.  We had to keep reaching out to them and had to resubmit several things. Not sure if they lost them or not, in February 2023 they sent us a check for what they thought was fair which was far less than what we should have gotten back.  We sent a response stating that we were not in agreement and have yet to this day heard back from them. Between all the time and effort, and the premium we paid for this insurance I would DEFINITELY NOT recommend to anyone thinking of taking out this insurance. It’s the biggest scam I’ve ever heard of!",1

Sevencorners,"They took airline credits totaling $13.4K- but in their ""settlement proposal""- they offered only $7.5K toward airline expenses.Also- they do NOT fully reimburse for a trip canceled because of sickness and eventual death- they manipulate and as others said- find every possible loophole to NOT pay.Their settlement was 65% of my submitted expenses- shameful!",1
Sevencorners,"purchased travel insurance through Go Ahead Tours, they use Seven Corners.  Flights were cancelled in Amsterdam and had to stay overnight.  Filed claim in June of 2022 and still haven't talked to anybody at Seven Corners just keep getting emails that they are backed up and working claims in order they are received.  I guess they have older claims than June of 2022 (almost 9 months) about to file a claim with the insurance commission on them if I can find out what state to file it in.  Have travel 5 times through EF/Go Ahead Tours and always bought travel insurance but never had to file a claim, the one time I file we get the run-a-round!!",1

Sevencorners,"Coverage start date: 9Feb2023Trip dates: 4-10Mar2023The sales people that we talked to on the phone were super patient, very experienced, great communicators, and very informative. After listening to what we were trying to cover in terms of trip and medical coverage insurances, they offered up great alternatives for consideration. Also, the informative emails/texts prior to and during our trip were very much appreciated.While not a complaint, the following comment is provided for information - my wife and I are almost 70 and are still in good health. We were looking for mostly medical travel related coverages, and not trip insurance. We were not able to find the right product on your website; in fact, we almost went to one of your competitors. Then, I remembered a conversation with Seven Corners’ Heather Kleinschmidt back in July 2022 on the same topic. So, we once again put a call into your sales team. When we talked to your sales agent Violetta Wooster, she explained to us the “roundtrip choice (AOS)” option. That option was exactly what we were looking for. It might be helpful for you to earmark that option early on in your website for the benefit of “older“ travelers. It turns out that we bought your roundtrip choice insurance on both occasions, once with Heather, and most recently with Violetta. Both sales agents were very informative, patient, experienced and professional. It was a pleasure working with both of them.",5

Sevencorners,Easy to apply for the service since it’s on line.,5
Sevencorners,"Took Travel and Medical insurance plan. Did not cover stolen phone during our trip to France. Coverage terms ensured lost and stolen items, but when we filed the claim, they just simply rejected it. Would not take this plan again or recommend it.",1
Sevencorners,No review text found,5
Sevencorners,It took way too long to finalize claim and I had to send in appeal for full amount that is still pending.  4 months is too long once the claim is filed.  Also the travel company doesn't tell you that you have to file direct to you within 90 days to even get reimbursed.  It really takes diligence to get claim processed.,2
Sevencorners,Have not heard back on a claim from June. They have no intention of actually paying anyone out should you need to file a claim.,1
Sevencorners,Everytime I need to talk to a human I can- so easy to work with!Thank you!,5
Sevencorners,"Extremely easy-to-use interface and seamless purchasing process.  I also did not have extra coverage needs for my most recent trip, so I was able to purchase a lower-cost solution vs. the more comprehensive solution, which saved me money.  I have been using Seven Corners for 4 years now and keep coming back due to the good pricing and ease of use.",5
Sevencorners,The agent we worked with laid out what we needed clearly and the online process was straightforward and relatively easy to navigate.  Add on insurance options were desirable and clear. Email reminders about trip and checklists provided were also helpful.   Thank you.,5
Sevencorners,"Both customer service agents were very respectful, efficient and helpful. I did not have to wait and wait and wait for results. It was a quick call and resolution.",5
Sevencorners,"Seven Corners is easy to set up and reasonably priced.  This is my second time buying insurance coverage from them.  Although nothing has happened to me YET in my travels, Mauritius and Turkey, I felt secure knowing I was “covered”.  Not sure about Seven Corners response time as I was lucky enough not to need them this year.  Going to Nigeria soon and planning on buying Seven Corners for the third time this year.",5
Sevencorners,"I filed a claim 5 months ago and I am still waiting for a settlement. Writing and calling does not help. They only give apologies and vague answers. Total rip off.In response to their reply, the email they sent says, ""I have reviewed your file and will be working on your behalf to resolve the issues. Please allow me time."" Just more of the same.",1
Sevencorners,"AMAZING!!!I have had my fair share of bad helplines but this is NOT one of them!I had the amazing Autumn who helped me so much.  I was panicking about my claim as I am from Scotland so this is all very new to me... she explained it so well and helped me every step of the way.I never write reviews (especially good ones) but I had to write one, mainly so Autumn knows I appreciate her so much.She even answered all my little questions so I was doing everything right and helped me for longer than she needed to, to make sure I was okay!Long Story Short - the help chat helped me so much and has given me a lot of reassurance.",5
Sevencorners,"We have worked with April several times on our trips, which are extended and not always to the friendliest places. She has been very informative and provided great consultation with spot on recommendations for our insurance needs for a particular trip. She has been friendly and very easy to work with.",5
Sevencorners,Seven Corners makes finding a reasonable and reliable travel insurer very easy through their website. It is easy to compare options. I appreciate their promptness in helping to solve any problem that arises with the insurer.,5
Sevencorners,"My representative, Heather, has been perfectly professional and responsive from the first time. I contacted her almost 2 years ago. The company’s product has been perfect for my constant, global travel and sailing adventures. I highly recommend the company and Heather!",5
Sevencorners,"They are a joke. I submitted a medical insurance claim, what I had bought the insurance for, for a hospital visit while in Thailand. Although only $61, which I had paid for in cash, I thought I'd submit it. They kept asking for more and more proof beyond the detailed hospital bills marked paid, such as proof from the airline I was in the country. Then they asked me to fill out forms that had nothing to do with my claim, such as regarding travel interruption, which was not my claim. Then they said - and this is an exact quote - ""We will try to resolve your claim in 130 days."" Are you kidding? Four+ months after I invested so much time with emails and paperwork for a stinking $61? I think they just make you do more and more until you give up. Perhaps only the people with a huge bill will have the energy to keep going. After weeks of this baloney, I guess they win. I will give up.",1
Sevencorners,"Originally liked the coverage and customer service. However due to age related reductions in medical care coverage, other policies became more attractive (more generous age-related coverage).",4
Sevencorners,Had a wonderful experience with Ms Heather Kleinschmidt. She explained thoroughly the coverages. I'm so pleased for the quick response. Excellent customer service.,5
Sevencorners,"If you get sick overseas and I did, it’s likely an emergency. You will go to the nearest place that WILL TAKE YOU and it doesn’t take this insurance. They will look at the card and say whatever. That means you have to pay for everything upfront and then spend a lot of time and effort to go chase Seven Corners for each claim. It’s not fun. It feels like a waste of time because medical care overseas is much cheaper.",3
Sevencorners,The claim process was very simple and straight forward. Though it took some time to resolve the issue I was happy with the outcome.,5
Sevencorners,I had general questions about my policy. The agent was enthusiastic and knowledgeable. She was extremely helpful,5
Sevencorners,"I had written a review a month ago regarding a claim that had been in process for 7 months. It has now been 8 months with no change. Seven Corners replied to my review and asked me to reach out which I did, and was told once again to just wait as they are behind on processing claims. I totally understand that they have a lot of claims coming in they have to process, but 8 months for a lost luggage claim that is straight forward is ridiculous. I continue to be told the claim has been escalated and to wait to hear from a representative in 7-10 days which has never happened. I have spent countless hours calling/emailing the company to be told differing information. I keep asking for any type of update and am told to just continue to wait repeatedly.",1
Sevencorners,"This company will not accept claims.  They act like they will pay out and that if you need to cancel an educational trip they will compensate you, but they will not.  EF tours and seven Corners are criminal.  DO NOT EVER USE THEM!  I beg of anyone that is looking into booking a tour or trip with either EF Tours or purchasing insurance through Seven Corners to run the other way!  I lost 10K, and they had not booked or scheduled anything.  I cancelled 5 MONTHS before the scheduled tour and they still said I did not qualify for any reimbursement.  Again I beg of you DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY!",1
Sevencorners,"Simple, fast, cost effective.  Great way to protect yourself when out of the country.",5
Sevencorners,Its been more than 60’days and my claim is still not reviewed. I expect timely response and claim reviews.,2
Sevencorners,"I purchased travel insurance and had to cancel the trip due to losing my job. I’m told it takes them 4 months to even get to the documents the make you submit. That’s ridiculous! It didn’t take 4 months to take my money when I purchased the policy. I’m sure they hope you forget about your money but they guessed wrong! I am putting reminders in my calendar to call and if they take too long I may sue. I’ve canceled trips with other companies and it was a smooth and easy process. Didn’t take anywhere near 4 months to process the claim let alone pay my money back. Beware of this company!!!!!They responded saying that they sent me an email however, I don’t have anything from them. I’ve heard this is the game they play for months.",1
Sevencorners,Agent was informative and resonsive.K,5
Sevencorners,Seven Corners made us wait months to process our claim then wouldn't pay our claim because of a tiny technicality. Our missed connecting flight was due to a 1 hour shutdown of airport security not due to a delay caused by our airline. So we had to pay our own hotel etc. to catch the next day's flight. And wait months to find out we weren't covered for this. Not a good experience.,1
Sevencorners,very easy to get coverage. made my trip less stressful knowing i had insurance,5
Sevencorners,Always easy to secure insurance for international trips.,5
Sevencorners,————————————-,5
Sevencorners,"While working with Seven Corners was very easy, I was extremely disappointed when I actually needed coverage.  I tested positive for COVID on a Friday evening in Israel.  In order to cover me, they needed a physician's clinical note.  While I understand this, I needed a new room that night, so that my roommate wasn't further exposed.  In Israel, most things are closed Friday night to Saturday night so getting the note would have been very difficult.  Had I been able to get the note, they would still have only covered $100 of the $400 cost of a room at such short notice.  This was NEVER made clear when I signed up.  Of course a hotel room would cost more than $100.",2
Sevencorners,"I submitted a very legitimate claim (clearly covid caused claim, everything was documented meticulously) EIGHT months ago, and they have twice asked for documents that I already submitted to them. TWICE, with weeks or months of silence in between me RE-submitting documents they already had. Every time I submit something they already have they think that allows them to add another 6-8 weeks to process the doc they already had.... Exhausting.8 months now and I am getting nothing but run-around and empty corporate-scripted apologies. After getting my case ""escalated"" recently, things could not be going slower. Feels great I tell you.What good is travel insurance if they don't pay you when you need it?There is a reason people don't trust insurance companies and Seven Corners is a shining example for the industry to follow.",1

Sevencorners,I always love the quick and efficient customer service I get from seven corners! 🙏🏽,5
Sevencorners,Your agent (Carly) went above and beyond to assist me with my claim.  She looked it up and noted that I had neglected to include my signature on page 6 of the claim.  She also recommended that I my file probably needed a confirmation report from the airlines.,5
Sevencorners,"As with any insurance, you buy it hoping you never need to use it. Trip insurance is no exception. We had peace of mind that in the event we were unable to go, we wouldn't be out the cost of the trip. Signing up was easy, the cost seemed pretty fair, and we had no issues at all.",5
Sevencorners,"I did not need to file any claims since my trip went off without any issues, but I felt I was fully covered with their insurance if anything did come up.",5
Sevencorners,"Not having any issues or disruptions with our travel made this an excellent experience. Having no need to make any claims, I really have no basis from which to give a worthwhile review. I made the purchase of our policy based on the reviews of others.",5
Sevencorners,The person on the phone was extremely nice and resolved my issue promptly. Really helpful. Great service - a good company to work with.,5
Sevencorners,Did not use insurance but peace of mind to know I had it. Cost was reasonable,5
Sevencorners,Good communication. Competitive pricing. Great coversge,5
Sevencorners,Talked with agent who clearly explained how 7 Corners works to fit our needs traveling to Argentina.   Good coverages for fair price.,5

Sevencorners,"I submitted my request in April of 2022.  All additional requests for information were submitted in November of 2022. To date,  I have  not received any monies due and it is nearly March of 2023.   It has been nearly a year since the first submission.  This is not a way to encourage customers to use your products. Since  I am still waiting for payment. I would not recommend your services to a friend as my experience has been quite unsatisfactory.P.STo add insult to injury, today I received a check in the amount of $300 but had been advised  by EF Go Ahead Tours that Seven Oaks should be sending me $1000,   They shorted me $700.  What a way to do business!  Really despicable!",1

Sevencorners,Great staff they handle all  our requestsPerfectly.,5
Sevencorners,"We received an email stating our claim would be paid.  But, only after nearly 6 months of numerous phone calls and emails sent. Each time seven corners would keep requesting additional information taking months, and only after we had contacted them. Most info. had already been sent with earlier documentation and receipts.  Really felt like they were hoping we'd give up? But we kept resending until we finally were notified of payment coming.  Except for additional frustration, we are happy with result.  We did receive our payment and though having to jump through many loopholes would definitely use seven corners again as they are a reputable company!",4
Sevencorners,"Knowledgeable and friendly customer service response to my questions on their phone line. Unfortunately, claims payment is slow and delayed. I've received multiple emails saying they are busy and overwhelmed with claims but no information on when I can expect payment. I recently had my auto totaled in a hit and run and the claim was paid in days by another insurance company. I made a small, clear medical claim with Seven Corners and they offer no information on when I can expect reimbursement. I've had better experience with other travel insurance companies.",3
Sevencorners,"The team at Seven Corners was great to work with to come up with the right travel insurance policy that made me comfortable.  They had the options I was most concerned about and I thought the cost was reasonable as I compared it to other company policies in the industry.  Although they were a little higher on the work cancellation reason, they also provided better coverage had I needed to use it.  I was glad I did not have to use the policy but it gave me peace of mind.  Thanks!!",5
Sevencorners,Employee was very very helpful and patient and friendly.,5
Sevencorners,"Quick and prompt answers, and knowledgeable about their product.",5
Sevencorners,"I am not satisfied with the claim process. The company takes about 20 business days to process my document. After 20 days, the claiming team asks me to add the more necessary documents to my file. After adding the necessary document, I will have to wait another 20 business days. And there is no way for me to ask to accelerate the process. I am still waiting now. And in my case, many claims after that case piled up and waiting there for this one case which was filed last July finished.  The staff is really helpful and friendly, but the claim process is not friendly.  I hope my case can be accelerated. Thanks!",5

Sevencorners,"I purchased trip insurance in December with the Cancel for Any Reason clause for a March trip.  My surgeon has told me I cannot start the March trip until I complete 1 extra week of Physical therapy, and therefore, the first three nights of my nonrefundable vacation rental can't be used.Seven Corners argues that there is NO coverage for the 3-night MEDICAL delay as it is not ""interruption,"" not ""delayed"" as the trip didn't start, and not canceled as I will be making the rest of the trip.  So NO Claim is possible even with medical necessity/form.Also, if I filed a claim for those first three nights, the rest of the trip is NOT covered as 1 claim voids out coverage for the rest of the trip I can make.They offered to let me buy a NEW policy for my new dates if I were to file a claim, which they indicated would be denied anyway.  Or the other option is just don't file a claim (absorb the 3-night non-refundable), and then they can adjust the policy to start the trip three days later, which I can then fully cancel if I want.The logic escapes me as the entire trip amount is 10X the price of 3 nights.  All the agent could do was read and read and read the same line and say the trip didn't begin, so no claim was covered or acceptable.Great options? I think the loopholes are stacked against all reasonable consumers, and medical notes should be honored under the DELAY (not just airport weather delays and flight cancelations).Seven Corners?... my last choice for the future.Update 3/4/23... Seven Corners responded to this 2/16 review with a request to recontact their advocates. I did so 2 times following their request, but neither time did I hear from another Seven Corners advocate. I now conclude the ""outreach"" by Seven Corners was more marketing than earnest customer interest.",1
Sevencorners,I really shouldn't be rating this yet as I haven't used it. I did have to see a doctor while traveling so I am in the process of submitting the claim but just read the paperwork and see I have to submit to my insurance first. Hopefully everything will go smoothly!,5
Sevencorners,"You offered travel insurance with covid coverage at a reasonable price. Fortunately, I didn't have to use it on my recent trip.",4
Sevencorners,"Janetta was very helpful.  However, the difficulties and the incredibly long length of time it is taking to recoup WHAT I HAVE PAID for through Go Ahead Tours, for the part of the tour I could not take because of being quarantined with COVID, has confirmed my decision to NEVER travel with EF-Go Ahead Tours ever again.",5
Sevencorners,"Just made the purchase--haven't had to make a claim yet (and hope we never do!) but the piece of mind is fantastic! Best rate for great coverage, and Joshua DeJong was a great help; very knowledgeable and helpful!",5

Wait time on both calls to reach a live representative was less than a minute.  All was accomplished efficiently and professionally.  Shout out to both Candy and Hannah.  Thank you both for your help.  Hopefully, our trip goes smooth and we won't need it any insurance, but you have to have it just in case.",5

Sevencorners,It was easy to purchase but the cost for limited coverage with many exclusions was no bargain. It seems that the travel insurance industry has as a whole excluded many conditions making coverage very limited for retired travelers.,4
Sevencorners,I filed a claim in July and still have not been paid.  My son and daughter received theirs but not me.  It has been 6 months,3
Sevencorners,"Buyer beware.  Read the fine print!  No reimbursement for trip delay for inconvenience.  We lost a full day of vacation because the flight was delayed a full day.  That possibility was the reason we bought the insurance in the first place. We were only reimbursed for the roundtrip Uber ride, not for delay of trip, since there was no direct financial expense involved in the delay.  I'll have to accept responsibility for not reading everything more carefully, but hope you do.  I'll not be doing business with Seven Corners again.",1

I guess when you are STRANDED IN A FOREIGN country, it doesn't qualify as an issue to this company. This company must be on the verge of bankruptcy if they aren't allowing people their refund for made-up reasons. They were stating false information in the denial of my claim.

Sevencorners,"Outright thieves! Not sure about all of these glowing (fake) reviews? We were stuck in a Latin American country for a week because of a nationwide strike and protests.

Excuses provided thus far, the 2020 Covid pandemic, understaff, the holiday season, new staff being trained, supervisors now have to approve every claim.

I didn't fall for it and a month later (after the deadline) I got a call from some guy asking me if I wanted to renew. I told him to check his records. This company is only good for taking your money - god forbid you have to make a claim.After the response: I don't see much need to deal with a company once they have clearly been dishonest and tried to manipulate me.,1
Sevencorners,"We always use Seven corners when traveling. We have never made a claim, but it is affordable and easy!",5
Sevencorners,"If you notice only customers with good reviews are the fortunate ones that felt secure with this insurance but never tested it through a claim. Be thankful your trip went well . All the others  like myself & my daughter waiting 6+ months with no update on their claim and no progress - they keep quoting "" world events ""- do not go with this company you are NOT insured with them they don't process claims or refunds -no updates and once you email they give you a run around",1
Sevencorners,"The best thing about this company is buying the insurance.  They have great customer service but if you happen to file a claim, you will be mothballed and given new requirements to fulfill.  I will never use this company again.   I filed my claim in July 2022 and it is still UNDER REVIEW!",1

Sevencorners,"The best thing about 'Seven Corners' travel insuranve was their agent: Joshua De Jong.  This was most important as I did not find the organization's website to be 'User Friendly' which it ought to be as many seniors like myself enjoy travel and feel the need to be protected.  I can't thank Mr. De Jong enough for always being able to reach when I had questions.  Fortunately, I had no need for making a claim but felt comfortable that I was insured to the max.  I look forward to using his service with Seven Corners in the future.   Improvements need to be made in accessing one's insurance on the web and finding it easy to work through.  This is the reason on star (above) is not green.   I was insured for 4 months of travel abroad.",4
Sevencorners,Fortunately all went well on our trip and so we never needed to use the insurance policy. But we were impressed with the customer service and the generous (medical) coverage.,5
Sevencorners,"It was a nightmare, wasted so much time trying to give them all the information they wanted. Very difficult to get them on the phone to ask questions.  Thought we had good insurance but turned out it was not.  In the end we did not even get back enough to cover our insurance.",1
Sevencorners,The operator was very nice and helpful,5
Sevencorners,"The school district used the company for an upcoming trip. Since booking and paying for the insurance my husband took a job . We moved, no longer in the school district. This company denied our claim. Because you have to be injured or deathly ill get a refund. Do not advise schools to use this company.",1
Sevencorners,Great representatives and friendly.However the detail in completing each accident which I had 5 in Greece and i sent a passport and date of entry and exit and repeating my payments with amex cc is very tedious. My certificate is #2LTPL-144056.  It is confusing to process so i will try next week after i process my tax return.. thanks.  I did send my passport and amex statement and entry and exit as i repeat myself . So any help you can provide would be great.  The reps did not have information to help me at this time only one occurrence was denied and one was under review and i have to repeat and give more information on my passport and entry and exit and amex payments,5

Sevencorners,"We have had a very frustrating experience dealing with Seven Corners.  No one gave us any answers, no one called us back, incorrect information was given, that is, until we connected with Richard Morales Romero.  Richard contacted the appropriate parties, gave us correct information and actually called us back when he said he would.  We finally connected with a diligent, competent employee who is an asset to your company.   Thank you, Richard!",5

Sevencorners,"We cancelled a trip the day before our departure due to Covid. We filed a claim the very next day and it took 6 months, nearly 30 hours on hold, 10 customer service agents who passed us on or assured us the refund was being processed, multiple submissions of the same documents over and over to finally get our money back. Sadly, this was a very straightforward claim that should have taken weeks, not months. I would never use this company again.",1
Sevencorners,Signing up was easy. Can't say much about anything else as I have not had a reason to file a claim yet and experience that process and turnaround time.,3

Received deposited in my bank account my full refund.1/18/2023UPDATE:  After I submitted the review detailed below, I received communication from Seven Corners’ escalation department.Given the name, one would think that finally this matter will be taken care of.  NOT!They only wrote to say I would get an answer in no more than 10 business days.  And AGAIN they lied.  When I called (and yes I had to contact the company - they did not reach out to me - all I got was more excuses about how busy they are and how many cases that have been escalated.This company is poorly managed to say the least.Original ReviewThis process has taken months and with zero communication regarding the status from Seven Corners.  This is unacceptable and extremely poor customer service.  I called AGAIN earlier this week and was told I should have received an email ( still have not) and that the claim should be settled this week.  I have provided more documentation than is required, and should be refunded 100%.  However, based on my experience thus far, and after reading the reviews of past clients, I have zero confidence in this company, regret using them, and I am only praying that they will do the right thing.🙏🏽",1

Sevencorners,"This company was excellent!It had great quality and service to clients,plus super helpful customerService!",5
Sevencorners,"The agents were friendly and helpful, and very willing to help me switch the dates on my travel policy. The whole conversation only took about 10 minutes. However, I was told my new policy would arrive in email in about 2 minutes, and that was an hour ago. I'm a little worried about whether it actually got changed, but I'm sure there is a reason why it didn't come.  CN # 2RTB22-AOS-118133",4
Sevencorners,"Worst travel health insurance ever - checked the policy before I went to the hospital, but because the hospital listed pregnancy as one of the codes (even though I was not treated for pregnancy) they refuse to cover the expenses. 6+ months worth of headache and stress whilst pregnant. NEVER AGAIN!!! Will do everything to avoid this company. Misleading and not transparent policy and claims procedure.",1
Sevencorners,The rep (Troy Lain) that assists me is great to explain all details.  When we did have to place a claim a couple of years ago because of getting covid and not making our trip....we were able to recover some of the costs.,5
Sevencorners,"We have no idea about the performance of Seven Corners. We just bought the insurance through their website for a single trip. There were no incidents during our trip, so there was no further contact needed.",3

Sevencorners,"Currently I am waiting on an actual update/ response to my claim submitted late November 2022. All I have received was anEmail saying my claim was received and I would get an update every 3 weeks.Unfortunately I had to cancel my trip to South Africa for my 35th birthday because my grandmother was taken to the ER one week prior, where we learned her cancer had spread and worsened, she was then referred to hospice care. As her primary caretaker and power of attorney it was recommended by her medical provider to not travel so far away for so long.I really don’t want to have to worry about my claim and this process as I am currentlyUnder a tremendous amount stress. I invested so much money and time into my birthday trip but my grandmother is more important. I’ve submitted her ER visit summary, her CT Scan, a letter from Hospice and everything else requested.It would be very helpful if I could get anActual update and this princess be expedited. It’s ridiculous that this process takes this long. I was skeptical about this company at first and probably should have went with another company if I knew it would take this long. I will wait a little longer before I contact the BBB.",2

Sevencorners,"My cruise was cancelled by the cruise line and I submitted my claim in October 2022 for the non-reimburseable charges, but have not received a response yet. The initial email said that it may take up to 6 weeks for review and processing so when I contacted Seven Corners in December 2022, I was surprised to find that my claim was still not reviewed and it may take up to 3 months for it to be even looked at.",1
Sevencorners,"The great thing is we didn't need to use our insurance, but your app, the pre- and during trip notifications and reminders were great.",5
Sevencorners,We were fortunate to not need to seek any medical attention while we were in Florida. I'm holding back one star just because I can't speak to how they come through when the coverage needs to be  used.,4
Sevencorners,"If I could give negative stars I would! This company is ridiculous. The amount of time that it takes to get any sort of response from them is horrible. When you send a message to ask for an update you will be given some generic email that states they are reviewing your claim and someone will respond shortly...then you are left to wait. The travel that took place was 7 months ago, this is not acceptable and how can this company be trusted to provide anything useful. If I don't hear back from them by the end of business day by the end of the week (01/06/23) I will take legal action.",1

Sevencorners,The team - when ever I calm people are always helpful and kind.  They really care about their customers.  I have been using 7C for a few years -and the amazing service is consistent.  They were really helpful and flexible with me moving coverage to rescheduled trips - this also allowed tour vendors to keep the payments I had made - at a time when this industry was hurting.  If ukulele need travel insurance - look no further - great people - great policies.,5
Sevencorners,I’m disappointed. This was purchased by my parents for a Christmas trip to Canada that was unfortunately canceled due to my fathers sudden diagnosis of terminal cancer. I called to get a refund and I was unable to.,1
Sevencorners,Features and price.  Great value.,5
Sevencorners,"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! I filed a claim for delayed baggage, they refuse to pay, has taken 5 months to finally tell me that. Baggage did not arrive for a 19 day cruise, I had to buy all new clothes, shoes, luggage, everything. International law requires the airlines to compensate for the delay, and they did. Four Cornes says ""The applicable benefit amount will be reduced by the amount of benefits, if any, previously paid by other insurance policies for the same loss."" International law requires the airlines to to make payment, this is deceptive advertising to claim they will pay benefits for delayed baggage when they know airlines are required to. I am filing a complaint with the State Insurance Commission for this fraudulent practice. Seven Corners was slow to respond, always apologized for the delay, kept asking for more documentation, escalated the claim, only to deny it 5 months later. Terrible experience!!",1
Sevencorners,The representative was very helpful with the process.,5
Sevencorners,"Nathan gave exceptional customer service. Even though it was not resolved in my favor, he explained why, and what my options were (appeal). He handled the situation very professionally.",5
Sevencorners,"They did not cover flight cancellation expenses incurred due to airplane mechanical failure.Also they did take over 6 months to respond.""Our investigation of these and any other submitted claims does not constitute and should not be construed as a confirmation that coverage applies.

Sevencorners,We filed a claim 6 months ago and we’re told that it is still under review. We were initially told that claim processing time was 110 days. We are now 30 days past that point and have not heard anything about our claim other than the times we have called for an update.,1
Sevencorners,"Seven corners are utterly horrible. Don't use them for travel insurance.First, they were impossible to reach while I had a medical emergency out of the country. That incident resulted in a travel delay. I claimed for a hospital visit and a flight delay charge.I submitted my claim in August 2022. I was told it would take 97 days to review. That is ridiculous.  In mid December 2022, they told me that they needed a further document. I provided that immediately. I was told that the claim would be escalated. 2 weeks later I followed up by phone and was told that it takes an additional 30 days to review updated documents from receipt.I'm now in my 6th month of dealing with this utterly incompetent and frustrating company.i asked to speak to a senior person there and was told that a supervisor was not available. I am currently waiting for a call back. I honestly don't expect the call.",1
Sevencorners,"We traveled in May, took till Dec to figure out they werent going to pay the claim.  Easy to purchase, Very dificult once you have a problem.  Travel was delayed, resolving, and getting back on track to join the tour we already paid for required a bit more ingenuity.  The John Hancock Silver Insurance was worthless, no out-of-pocket but justifiable expenses were covered.  Didn't even get the original cost of the insurance back and took them 8 months to figure it out.   Just a payment for nothing.",1
Sevencorners,3 Stars given only because we didn’t need to use any of the travel insurance that we purchased so really can’t give a review,3

Sevencorners,"I have been dealing with this company for 6 months. We got Covid in Vienna, Austria in April and had to stay a few more days before we could get back. It’s been a nightmare. They keep asking for more forms. I’ve called numerous times over the last 6 months. I think of all the hours I’ve spent dealing with them! Still no money. Overall, a nightmare!",1
Sevencorners,"I’ve purchased and used multiple travel insurances and I wouldn’t recommend seven corners. I chose them recently because of the reviews and decided to purchase their more expensive coverage. Thankfully I didn’t need to use them during the trip, but when I contacted them after for damaged luggage, they were so slow to respond and it took months to even get a response that wasn’t even the completion of the claim. Their excuse is covid but if you’re going to charge people for a service and can’t handle the influx of claims, you shouldn’t be handling travel insurance.They’re not a scam and have been fine when they responded, but I never used them to completion when I needed them and gratefully I didn’t have to use them while on my trip because they would’ve been so frustrating and unhelpful.Update: I just wanted to add to my review after the seven corners’ response because saying you’re going to follow up, doesn’t negate my underlying feedback and review. I said the response time and overall coverage was inadequate, which I still believe it is. Saying you’re going to follow up to publicly appease viewers is poor form and to be clear, a customer advocate did not follow up and since seven corners seems to respond faster to reviews than it’s actual customers, I won’t be moving forward with my claim. I actually opted to go through my credit card, which resolved this faster.",3
Sevencorners,"I have actually been using 7 Corners since 2010.  i have always found them extremely helpful, knowledgeable and very easy to deal with .  The last two years I have been working with April Welch with very large lists of employees traveling all over the world.  She has been my lifeline to have these policies purchased in a timely fashion.  She is wonderful to deal with even when we have changes.  My life is much easier because of working with her and 7 Corners.",5
Sevencorners,"Due to Covid, our 13 day trip to Italy was interrupted in June and we were required to quarantine starting on day 4. We requested a claim form as soon as we returned home. It took 5 months and repeated contacts to get a determination that our claim was denied due to not having seen a physician while in Italy. The tour company required us to quarantine. We submitted photos of our positive Covid tests. There was no treatment available for Covid other than over the counter medications. However, the policy stated a physician’s signature prior to any medical interruption was required, so Seven Corners has denied our claim, and according to reviews on Facebook, many other claims for the same reason.",1
Sevencorners,It was easy to change the time period of the insurance.,5
Sevencorners,Very easy company to work with. They have the travel insurance we need at a reasonable price too.,5

Sevencorners,"Updated Jan 2023: After some back and forth and submitting more paperwork, I did finally receive reimbursement for some covid related travel extension costs making the original premium worthwhile.original review: Consider another policyI bought the Roundtrip Choice policy for our family last Christmas, just in case there were any covid related travel issues. Out of 5 people, I got covid and had to change flights to come back days later. Much of my costs incurred should have been covered, but it has been a year of ""we are reviewing your paperwork"" and I still have nothing reimbursed. At this point, I would be happy with my policy premium back if nothing else.",3
Sevencorners,Excellent customer service resolving a problem with my purchase!,5
Sevencorners,Reasonable pricing and flexibility to cancel a tour and transfer policy to rebook for different dates. Coverage was adequate for medical and travel expenses.,5
Sevencorners,"Never with this Seven Corners again. We insured a combination trip to Germany and Greece. We had 2 independent claims, one was a missed connection flight due to a severe storm, which is covered per policy, and secondly, a trip interruption with cancelation of the vacation in Greece due to my husband getting sick in Germany and being admitted to the hospital through the emergency room. Seven Corners declined ALL claims. While I can accept that they deny the cancellation and trip fees for the Greece-part of our trip, because we canceled from Germany, because my husband didn't feel well and we didn't consult with a physician prior to cancellation, there is no reason why the medical expense was denied, and also why the costs for our missed connection flight on the way to Germany was denied. Upon asking for an explanation- I just received a general statement, not even addressing why the medical expense itself and the second independent claims was denied, and giving me psychological support for denying the claim. Stay away from Seven Corner! They cheat you!Update: Seven Corners responded to this review saying that they look at my claim again and an advocate will contact me. Nothing has happened and nothing will come off it. It is a computerized-standardized response, which I have now found in many complains about Seven Corners. They screen for negative reviews and that response is intended to  mitigate  negative reviews and reel in more stupid victims to cheat out of legitime claims.Avoid John Hancock-Seven Corners!!",1
Sevencorners,"I STRONGLY advise to do your research.Since I have written about my dealings with Seven Corners I have since found out that even some of the third party companies that sell their policies are taking them on for their handling of claims (or lack thereof).Once again, I'm happy for those few who had ""great and wonderful"" experiences with their claim.  To those that think giving them your money easily rates a 5-star review - better hope you never need any money back from them.",1
Sevencorners,"24+ weeks for claim processing. blatant lies from both EF and seven corners. claim payment less than half the total amount of claim AND processed in wrong currency. denial of highest ticket item on claim (greyhound bus tickets) with explanation of ""not local transportation"" yet uber rides were covered. the whole thing is a farce. vague language and questionable interpretation of ""policies"" by ""trained advisors"". if your policies need ""trained advisors"" for interpretation  that's a huge red flag for the general public. I've requested to be given these policies and as of right now have not received them so that i may read them for myself. all i want is a FULL reimbursement of everything i spent to get us home after being stranded in YYZ with no assistance from EF. check out the many reviews on the better business bureau website before using this company for anything.",1
Sevencorners,Agent was very efficient and gave clear information. It was a much better experience than I expected as I thought it would be more complicated.,5
Sevencorners,"The company did not pay for trip interruption while I was in a COVID isolation hotel in Australia because I didn't see a physician. I feel that that requirement should've been waived in this time, as their government had just opened the country for travel and had put strict policies in place. We were not allowed to leave our rooms unless we had to go to an ER. This is the whole reason we bought insurance.",1
Sevencorners,"Although I didn't need to use the insurance, thankfully, it was a big relief when planning a huge trip like we did.  I had zero problems getting the coverage from an extremely nice and helpful customer service person.  It was almost too easy!",5
Sevencorners,"This was literally the worst experience ever. I filed a claim for getting COVID back in July on a trip - was planning to stay with friends but obviously could not when I tested positive. So I booked a hotel room and called Seven Corners to check on what my benefits were, they said it would be covered up to $1,000. Completely unprofessional to claim backlog for months on end, the default assumption should not be that a customer has to wait 3.5 months to even get her claim looked at. Have spent the next 6 months on hold, emailing, and talking to various unhelpful customer service representatives. Each one has a different opinion and each time I'm missing something else or I should just wait a week and call back then. Seems like a deliberate and obvious scam - everything is insured allegedly until you actually file a claim. I bought a round-trip cancel for any reason policy and specifically checked that it would cover a hotel room for isolation if I got COVID. Deliberately misleading sales pitch to assure us that COVID expenses would be covered and to assure me on the phone when I had COVID that staying in a hotel was covered by my policy. I will never buy travel insurance with you again and neither will anyone I know.",1

Aftre 9 months receive an email saying case was closed and I never got any money for  the price that I paid to exachnge the ticket,1
Sevencorners,"They deserve a 0 star rating but survey required I give them at least 1. I used them for our group travel to Ecuador this summer. Because of the protests and violence we had to alter our plans. So claims were filed for the group. While the insurance was a group insurance plan, they can't seem to be able to handle claims as a group. In addition to completing numerous forms, I had to write a letter to explain the reasons for the claims and provided numerous pieces of documentation including an alert issued by the state department. In the letter I requested the claim agent give me a call to discuss because I knew the claim would be difficult to understand. Months had gone by before I receive any sort of response and it was obvious the didn't review any of the information provided. As of this date, approximately 5 of the 18 claims have had any response and we are going on 6 months since the claim was filed. I have made numerous attempts to reach an agent just to be given the run around by a call center agent. I requested to speak to a supervisor and all I got was one will call you back in 1-2 days. When they did call back, I was unavailable so they simple sent an email indicating your claims are still be looked at. They will be more than happy to sell you a plan, just don't count on them to support you after the sale.Updated: I've used Seven Corners for mission trips over the last 5 or 6 years but alas no more. Company will be quick to make a sale, not so much to service it after the fact. A simple review of the feedback on this site shows that their inability to service after the sale.",1

I found the staff to be helpful as I made my claim and provided information and once the claim was established in their online system, it was easy to email or upload supporting documents.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars was the length of time the claim took - 6 months.  However, I am pleased and would use them again.",4
Sevencorners,"Enjoyed the easy process to purchase travel insurance with them, but HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED by how they handle claims especially a simple baggage delay claim.Can't imagine the damage I would've had to endure if there was a death claim...In short, for a company that has so many fine prints, I would've have expected their claims agents to have better attention to detail.I did a multi-city trip and actually didn't even fly ""home"" yet.But according to them, my baggages (worth about $1000+) are NOT COVERED because it was on my return trip home...I'm still traveling for work!Disappointing. I had high hopes for Seven Corners...but, they're not speedy or dependable.P.S Claims take 60+ days to process...",1

I filed a claim on 8/9/2022 and to date the claim hasn't been touched. I have called, e-mailed and Facebook chatted with them and all they have to say is that they are late with their claims. After interacting online with other customers on facebook, I am yet to hear from one who has been reimbursed. My husband has since died, I need the money back, and I also need piece of mind to grieve and not have to deal with this terrible business. I wish I could rate it zero starts. Customers be aware!",1
Sevencorners,"I submitted my travel claim 7/8/2022. My experience with Seven Corners has been absolutely terrible. I plan to describe it on social media so that others can understand and avoid the frustration I have been through. I filed my claim almost 5 months ago!Since then I have spent countless hours with Seven Corners customer service trying to get my claim processed. I even asked to have it expedited for financial reasons. Nothing.For starters, I spent several weeks communicating and sending documentation to wrong companies who had received my claim. It seemed my claim was being sent  around to several wrong companies, perhaps a Starr Insurance (?) and then 2 other companies called Squaremouth and Broadspire.  I spent hours filling out my claim information on these incorrect online sites, sending followup emails and speaking with their service reps.I was then told by a company, perhaps Starr,  to contact Seven Corners, again sending all my documentation to your site. After going back and forth regarding details of my submittal, including the absence of my bank's logo on my online bank statement, which the bank does not provide, I was assured I would get my refund in early October.When I called, about the 8th time for a status, I was told I needed to sign a ""Disclosure to Release Funds"" which I was asked to send as, surprisingly, hadn't been sent. Had I not called, I probably would still be waiting for it. I returned it and heard nothing but ""You will receive an email notice when we send your check.""Last week I sent another email to check on the status and received an email that ""we need the member's date of birth"". This seems like a series of innocuous requests from you company, over 5 months, to avoid payment. Pretty sure with all the documentation you have on hand from myself and John Handcock, whom you represent, that you already have that information.From my dealings in the business world , my experience here has been absolutely horrendous. I've heard excuses due to ""long refund times"" from Seven Corners, using COVID as an excuse, understaffing, etc. You would certainly think a company would increase their staff due to anticipation of increased claims from COVID.I plan to share this most frustrating and time-consuming experience, starting with Facebook and Yelp, for both John Hancock and Seven Corners. I have no idea of ""if"" or ""when"" I will ever receive my refund.Yours truly,Joan Beesley",1

Sevencorners,I bought insurance for our cruise. Very happy about the ease of the purchasing process and especially happy about the excellent customer service. Will use this company again!,5
Sevencorners,"Read all the one star reviews!!! I would have given 5 stars for the easy access to purchase it for piece of mind. It’s a whole different ballgame if you actually have to file a claim in 2022. If you enjoy waiting for months and jumping through hoops this is for you! Filed a claim July 11, 2022.",1
Sevencorners,"The agent offered a more viable and economical package for me and my husband based on what we needed. I rated it one star down because when I had a follow-up inquiry, the agent did not return my call.",4

Sevencorners,"Our son had a school trip planned for 2021 and then it was cancelled because of Covid 19/ pandemic. Trip was rescheduled for 2022, but the requirements for vaccine were implemented. So, we followed through with the changes, but prior to the trip the was left in another state. Attempted to retrieve document in time, by scheduling a round trip flight to the location where card was, but just as we got to airport the flight was cancelled.Our son waited approx. three (3) years for this trip and these two companies (Seven Corners & EF Tours) will take any means necessary to justify not paying anything out of their pocket. If they at least offered a future trip as an option would worth considering, but nothing was even offered.Shawn D.",1
Sevencorners,Easy to work with.  Good price.,5
Sevencorners,You never know how good the trip insurance is until you file a claim. Seven Corners has exceeded my expectations. My wife and I tested positive for Covid the day before we were supposed to come home. We missed the last day of our tour and had to spend an additional nine days in Ireland before we tested negative and could get our plane tickets to come back home. It took almost six months to be fully reimbursed for almost all the money we spent while recovering from Covid. I would not hesitate to use Seven Corners again.,5
Sevencorners,"Unfortunately, I must agree with the negative reviews for this company.I have used Square Mouth to purchase cruise travel insurance for years and have always purchased the same policy.  As most of the positive reviews here state, the purchase itself was easy and smooth.  Having to file my first ever claim to be reimbursed a small amount of money ($1430) because I tested positive for COVID after getting off a ship in Vancouver which prevented me from flying home, has been a disaster in terms of dealing with Seven Corners.The claim was filed on 5/22/22 with all the required documentation.  Made double sure to include everything requested, outlined it, highlighted it and everything was straightforward.Waited 30 days before first follow-up via e-mail.  Received a response telling me they were ""upset about the wait time too"" and ""to be assured my claim would be reviewed"" and they would ""e-mail me every 3 weeks with an update on my claim.""Over the course of the next few MONTHS I had be the initiator for follow-up and only then would I get the same ""form"" e-mail telling me the the exact same information.Finally on 9/14/22 I received a different request.  They now wanted a copy of my credit card statement showing I had, in fact, paid the charges submitted.  That was the only thing requested and I sent this information back via e-mail the same day.From that point - radio silence.  Reached out several times over the next few weeks and couldn't even warrant a reply of the standard ""form"" e-mail telling me they were ""upset about the wait time too.""Finally I reached out to Square Mouth, the 3rd party vendor I purchased the policy through.  They have a ""Zero Complaint"" department to assist with just such issues.  I scheduled a phone meeting with one of Square Mouth's ""Zero Complaint"" representatives.  We had our conversation on 11/2/22 and she stated she would send a follow-up request to Seven Corners.I know this will sound unbelievable but Seven Corners actually sent an email to me within 48 hours - denying my claim.The money is not the issue, it's not a large amount.  The aggravating part is they only responded after I got Square Mouth involved, and then apparently decided quickly to just deny and move on.The reason for denying was due to me not going to a physician (in Vancouver) and getting diagnosed with COVID and then having said physician ""restrict"" my travel.  Seriously Seven Corners?  The UNITED STATED OF AMERICA CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL had a mandate in place back in May which clearly stated if you tested positive for COVID within one (1) day of a scheduled flight into the United States, you were NOT allowed to fly into the United States and would be denied boarding.  I didn't need a physician to restrict me, the U.S. Government did.  I did, however, submit a video proctored COVID test which confirmed my positive results.   Further, why did Seven Corners request a copy of my credit card statement if this is the reason behind them denying my claim?  Doesn't make a lot of sense.So, to control costs (i.e. 10 day hotel bill for quarantine), I booked travel from Vancouver to Seattle via bus, as land borders had no restrictions for entering the U.S., and I changed my flight from Vancouver to Seattle (domestic flights did not require tests).  I double-masked up and got home without having a huge bill to file with, what I thought was, my quality travel insurance plan.  Instead what I got from them was nothing.  Lesson learned.Sorry for such a long post, but consumers deserve to know what others go through with a company.  If you're fair, you deserve praise and good reviews.  Unfortunately, Seven Corners does not deserve a pat on the back for the way they handle claims.PLEASE, Seven Corners, do not ask ME to reach out to you via email as you have done so much on this board.  I've done enough of that.  If you want to review the situation, YOU need to initiate the contact this time.",1
Sevencorners,I would highly recommend this to anyone willing to do a little of the work themselves that has the ability to negotiate without letting emotions get involved.I had the great pleasure of dealing with this company. They answered all questions and provided me with the best plan for my needs. Thanks!,4

Sevencorners,When I called the rep told me not to pay for doctors visit and have them bill seven corners.  What doctor in any part of the world is going to take a stranger word to not pay and bill my insurance from another country.I also emailed for support to change my days and country.  I got no response.When I called again for 3rd time the rep told me she was not sure what was covered.I would not use this company again for travel insurance.,1
Sevencorners,"*UPDATE* To respond to Seven Corners that they emailed me regarding my claim- Your email (so that everyone can see) is exactly ""We have other escalated claims and to be fair to our customers, we process those in the order received as well. Please allow a little more time for your claims advisor to respond back.""When Sever Corners actually resolves this to my satisfaction, I will update this review. Just sending me an email asking me to wait a little longer is not helping.BUYER BEWARE!I prefer to give this company 0 stars but have to give them at least 1 to post. I submitted my claim 130 days ago (18.5 weeks).  Absolutely no information has been provided on why there is such a delay, despite my repeated emails, phone calls, and even 'chats'.  All I ever get is the canned response, ""your claim will be processed in the order received."" Initially I was told 110 days.  That has since passed. I have requested it to be escalated 10/27/22. 19 days since escalation and NOTHING.  I have asked over and over if there is additional documentation needed to process the claim.  Each time I am told no, I just have to wait for it to be processed.  Last week I spoke with a manager and he stated the claim was in claims manager review and I should expect a response via email within 1-2 days.  Again, nothing. The only reason this company gets 4 and 5 stars is because those folks never file a claim as stated in their review.  Good luck if you actually have a valid claim.",1

Sevencorners,"The educational tour company my daughter was going on a school trip with made it mandatory to show a negative PCR covid test to fly. My daughter tested positive days before the trip. I emailed Seven Corners a few times asking if they needed anything other than what was on the list they provided me and that I had sent them. My daughter was asymptomatic, the covid numbers were high, and everyone was told NOT to go to the doctor unless they needed to. I called Seven Corners and asked if my daughter needed to see a doctor for insurance reasons. I was told that she did NOT need to see a doctor because no matter what a doctor said, she still would not be allowed to fly. I submitted the insurance claim immediately. The time frames given proceeded to get longer and longer. It's now been 5 months and I received a denial letter stating she was denied because she didn't see a doctor. They had only been talking to me, her mom, for the entire 5 months. After I said I was going to make a formal complaint, they said they needed to verify me. Then they said they couldn’t speak to me unless my daughter, who was a minor when we got the insurance, signed a form stating they could talk to me. In the meantime, I reached out to my daughter's teacher and explained the situation. They responded to her saying, “Our Traveler Support Team has processed Clarice’s claim and is refunding $4,070.” They never asked the teacher to get authorization. When I reached out to them regarding what the teacher showed me, they denied me again. Simply put, this company is immoral. ***The insurance was taken out BEFORE covid was a thing. And we know that covid changed everything. Which is why when I called the insurance company and spoke to an agent I said, Is there anything else I need to do? Does my daughter need to see a doctor for insurance reasons? Because she can't go no matter what. Seeing the doctor makes no difference. The rep responded with, exactly. No she does not need to see a doctor. The PCR test is the only thing needed. This was during a time when covid numbers were high and the United States government asked that people who tested positive for covid, that were not seriously ill, NOT take up space so more sick people could be seen. This was the government asking. And I STILL asked Seven Corners if I should take my daughter in. Seven Corners said that I did NOT need to have my daughter seen. I don't think listening to the government and also double checking with the insurance company should result in my claim being denied.",1
Sevencorners,"It was very easy to set up and understand all that our policies covered making getting the right coverage for our trip to Indonesia possible.

They take weeks if not months to respond to emails and they only respond when I follow up with them on countless occasions. They keep saying I need to provide medical records from abroad when I saw a doctor due to an emergency but I've submitted everything I have (which is understandably not much since it was a visit to a random doctor, not my own!) Apparently all the receipts, scans, prescriptions was not enough. They also blamed it on a ""pre-existing condition"" which it in fact was not at all - first time experiencing this medical situation. Complete BS. What a waste of money I've spent on long term travel with them. Will no longer be recommending to family or friends.",1

Sevencorners,"This was the first time I've ever worked with a travel insurance company and the worst customer service I've ever experienced.  Five months after filing a claim for our group trip that was interrupted by both my husband and I contracting Covid-19, the company has found excuses to deny our claim.  I thought I was protected on my trip but found that I've just wasted all the time, energy and $700 plus that I spent on these policies.  We were quarantined in Ireland after we were sent to a lab in Cork where we got positive PCR tests, and missed the rest of our scheduled tour.   I called my doctor back in the states to try to get a prescription to no avail and tried to see if we could get into a local doctor also with no success.  Never mind that doctors did not want to see Covid-19 patients and that we were stuck in a foreign country with no transportation.  Company says you didn't get medical care, you're out of luck. Wish we would have called an ambulance and charged that to the travel insurance also.  Had no idea that not being able to see a doctor would disqualify us from coverage.   I guess our travel company thought that the PCR test was adequate medical care because they said we would be covered. This is not what I call customer care.",1

Sevencorners,"Seven Corners does not cover mental health emergencies, even when a letter by a licensed clinician recommending no travel is provided.  They state the counselor must have “prohibited” travel.  A psychologist is, of course, not legally or ethically able to “prohibit’ travel.  They can only “strongly recommend”, as was written by the clinician for the case in question.Haven’t we gotten past this as a society?  Don’t we know to take mental health seriously?That is not the case with Seven Corners.Response to Seven Corners’ reply to OP:  a licensed clinician letter strongly recommending against travel for a minor child in a mental health crisis was provided to Seven Corners when filing reimbursement claim.  The company physician statement was completed by the licensed clinician. The response from this company was that “the traveller wasn’t explicitly prohibited” so the clinician’s letter was disregarded.Seven Corners: what phrasing should a clinician use to have you cover the cancellation, if concern about grave danger to child was insufficient?",1

Sevencorners,"Note that almost all the four and five star reviews here are from people who got a policy but who didn't need to make a claim. The one star reviews are from those of us who actually tried to file and collect on a claim. It took Seven Corners over four months to decide to deny my two claims. The reasons for they gave for denial are worth noting, should you consider purchasing a travel policy from them.My first claim was for expenses incurred when my outbound international flight was canceled less than 24 hours prior to departure. As a result I was charged for a no-show at my hotel. However, my claim was denied solely because I had prepaid for my hotel. Per my denial letter ""your Trip Delay coverage only covers Reasonable Expenses that were a direct result of the delay and had nothing to do with any pre-paid expenses like the hotel that charged you no-show fees.""My second claim was based on contracting Covid while on my trip. As a result I was unable to return as scheduled and had to pay for flight change fees and additional nights at a hotel until I tested negative and could board a plane - ironically, the precise situation for which I got insurance! However, my claim was denied because my positive diagnosis was made in a mandated government clinic rather than being""... examined, treated, and ordered to quarantine by a legally qualified physician and have documentation of said quarantine order...""Lessons learned: 1) if your trip is delayed, don't expect any prepaid charges to be reimbursed, and 2) if you are unlucky enough to contract Covid on your trip,  don't expect a diagnosis from a mere government clinic (the one you have to visit to be cleared to depart) will be sufficient to claim your Covid-related expenses.In summary, my trip was a complete bummer, and the small measure of security I'd hoped to achieve through my Seven Corners policy was an utter waste of money. The restrictions they place on trip delay and illness are impractical and unrealistic - which is, I suppose, exactly their intent. Caveat emptor.",1
Sevencorners,"I purchased an expensive CFAR travel policy through Seven Corners and was underwritten by John Hancock. Unfortunately I needed to file a claim due medical reasons.

They then denied my claim for insufficient documentation. I provided JH with all required documentation per their website. JH wanted proof of purchase (understandable). I provided a paid receipt from my travel supplier. JH then requested credit card statement or copy of check but I paid by wire transfer which JH wanted copies of which I am struggling to provide since I paid my deposit over a year ago.. My issue with JH is that their website states proof of purchase as a ""travel provider invoice"". I don't understand how JH can put their requirements on their website but not honor them.My advice: RUN, DO NOT WALK away from Seven Corners and JH. There are many providers for travel insurance providers, research them but don't use JH as they lack the integrity to honor their own statements!!",1
Sevencorners,I filed a claim back in August 2022. It is now mid October 22 and I have yet to have anyone contact me to follow up. I tried to view status on line. All it says is that it was received. I then waited a very long time on the phone pretending to be a new client for travel insurance as it was the only way to get connected to a human being. It was then told to wait at least 92 days to hear back from seven corners on my claim…. Wow! Is all I can say.,1

Sevencorners,Tried and tried to get answers to questions about how to expand geographic area of travel and also about how to submit claim after a street accident and injury. No one responded. Quick efficient subscription and payment system but bad client responsiveness.,2
Sevencorners,"Nathan provided exceptional customer service.  He was kind, thorough, patient.  He went above and beyond to provide support and meet my needs’",5
Sevencorners,Purchased based on decent reviews and coverage.  Found out they don't cover what they claim to cover - additional expense to recover lost bag.  My son's backpack was lost in the airport and eventually found and shipped back after we returned from the trip.  We had to pay ~$300 for airport lost and found to ship it back.  Seven Corners denied our claim.  Their policy says additional expense associated with lost bag is covered.  Nowhere did it say the bag had to be lost by the airline.  Nor did it say expense to recover the lost bag is not covered.  But they denied the claim.,1
Sevencorners,"Review of Seven Corners. Agent (Heather) was super helpful in figuring out what coverage we needed. Couldn’t have done it without her! Fortunately we did not have to use anything, but I felt more at peace knowing what we had.",5
Sevencorners,Unfortunately I have to give one star as the lowest rating it should be lower.  They denied our claim because we did not see a physician when testing positive for COVID-19 one day before our trip.  Received positive test from nurse at CVS and confirmed with a home test after that.  Followed CDC guidelines to not travel and quarantine at home.  This was inadequate for Seven Corners and they denied our claim.  We are our over 8K after four month delay and deny tactics from Seven Corners.  I have files a complaint with BBB and written a letter to State Cooperation Commission to try and prohibit them from doing business in Virginia.  Sham of a company and complete waste of money.  I have wasted not only over $2000 dollars for the upgraded cancel for any reason insurance I also wasted about twenty hours in research and paperwork to satisfy their requirement to submit a claim they simply denied.,1
Sevencorners,Purchase process was easy. We had one claim but the Claims processing was longer with resubmissions of the forms multiple times. Overall the coverage was as listed in the policy and services were good.,4
Sevencorners,I cannot provide a review because I didn't have to use the insurance.,5
Sevencorners,"I have had no communication from them and it's been over 3 months since I submitted my claim, no indication that it has moved anywhere at all. The usual excuse of ""we're experience higher volume than normal"" is not valid, COVID isn't impacting like it was, surely there is some legal limit on how long acknowledging a claim takes. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",1
Sevencorners,No review text found,5
Sevencorners,Fortunately I did not have any reason for filing a claim. The reason I gave a 3 star is due to the difficulty I had with communication especially with calls and desiring to talk with a representative. Return calls were untimely.  I did receive email notices prior to my trip providing phone numbers and coverage summaries which were appreciated.,3
Sevencorners,No review text found,5
Sevencorners,Claim process is a nightmare. Takes forever to process. They cancel the check without notifying us.,3
Sevencorners,"The one time I needed to call Seven Corners - to get a referral for a doctor while traveling - I got put on hold and never spoke to anyone. I ended up solving the problem on my own, but the lack of responsiveness with this phone call is a service issue for me.",3
Sevencorners,My salesperson was great to explain what we could get and the various different policies. We have returned home from a wonderful trip and thankfully did not need to use our policy. But glad we had it in case of emergency.,5
Sevencorners,"Thankfully, we did not have any issues that would have caused us to file a claim. I have used Seven Corners for several trips and the only time I had to file a claim, they were very prompt in processing it to my satisfaction. Will continue to use Seven Corners as my travel insurance provider.",4
Sevencorners,I requested insurance on line one day before I needed it. Within 24 hours my insurance was in place. Thank you,5
Sevencorners,Now nothing but emails that I don't want to see. STOP,4
Sevencorners,"I had a claim. I had lost my phone on an international trip. Now, 3.5 months later, and after 23 emails back and forth, they STILL haven't resolved my claim. They've asked me for the same documents more than once. They are nearly impossible to get in contact with. They apparently don't call clients back when asked to. I am definitely not going to use them again.",1
Sevencorners,They listed themselves as available 24/7.  When I called their collect phone number there was no one available and no opportunity to leave a message.,1
Sevencorners,"Terrible customer service and payment record.I submitted a claim on 04/29/22 for a 05/1/22 trip. I had cancer surgery on 05/4. The claim was filed CORRECTLY along with the physician statement. The claim wasn't paid until 09/26/22.I tried numerous times to call and email them but they don't respond to inquiries. I had to threaten a lawsuit to get paid.My advice is to use a big, well known company. Seven Corners appears to have cash flow problems. Never again will I use them or EFTours!",1
Sevencorners,"I am very unhappy with their handling of our Covid related claim...denied everything saying we didn't meet their requirements. We had a terrible time reaching an agent while sick in Europe, then was told to find our own medical help. We did and now that's the basis for their denial. I am filing a claim with the NH state insurance board. Don't trust this company!",1
Sevencorners,There isn't actually much to say because we had no need to use our coverage. Seven Corners was very responsive when we had to postpone our trip for a year. No problem in extending coverage and easy communication with agency representatives by phone. Easy to get answers to questions and explanations of coverage.,5
Sevencorners,Seven Corners took the worry about our two week trip to Portugal. We haven't traveled for a while since COVID-19 and Seven Corners' program gave us confidence.,5

Sevencorners,I'll be better able to provide an adequate review if and when my claim for cancellation is complete. It has been 4 weeks thus far and no word from the company.,4
Sevencorners,Used seven seasons last year. Made a new policy for traveling in 2022-2023. Highly recommend.,5
Sevencorners,Pros: Privately owned; Informative and easy to navigate website; efficient enrollment; economical yet generous coverage.Cons: None experienced for the trip/occasion. Will use again for next int’l trip.,5
Sevencorners,Great app. Easy to use,5
Sevencorners,Insurance company refusing to pay for tests ordered by physician in a visit covered by insurance.,2
Sevencorners,"Seven Corners Travel Insurance is the worst travel insurance company you can ever deal with. I’ve paid them premiums for more than two years, and when I had to file a claim, it stayed in their office for over FIVE MONTHS , and haven’t heard back yet . The only claim they paid me , was not paid to me , it went to the wrong people after they have confirmed it went to May bank account 😡😡 .  I can’t imagine how they operate. Every time I call, they advise that they will escalate it and a supervisor will get back to me , big lie as no one ever did .#jaybrown who is the one handling the claims is not knowledgeable , very rude, and ignores all emails which shows how their customer service is .Please think twice before purchasing their travel insurance as they are the biggest liars I’ve dealt with 😡😡😡",1
Sevencorners,Customer service was very good plus communication from Seven Corners advising when the policy started and when it ended was very helpful.  Thank you.,5
Sevencorners,Our trip was canceled twice due to Covid and Seven Corners worked with us on each postponement to keep our policy in effect.,5
Sevencorners,"THE ABSOLUTE WORST!!My claim has been submitted over 6 months now. Since then there has been little to no information forthcoming from these frauds, despite my countless emails to them. Stay clear from these people.",1
Sevencorners,"Professional staff. When I needed help, the office provided assistance in helping me secure a policy that met our needs.  This is our third time purchasing an insurance policy for Seven Corners.  We are pleased with the options the policy provided.  The language is clear and the price point is affordable.",5
Sevencorners,"It was impossible to renew the same policy.  Only a much more expensive policy was offered.  That amounts to a practice of ""bait-and-switch.""",1
Sevencorners,I have always been very happy with Seven Corners. Response has always been timely in my (and my family's) international travel. You are seriously covered without question.,5
Sevencorners,Because I had other coverage through my work all my wife and I needed was medical evacuation coverage for our trip to Greece. It wasn’t clear on any of the insurance websites how to tailor coverage to our needs. I connected with Jona by phone who recommended Basic coverage and sent me several alternatives. Basic met our needs. Jona followed up on line which impressed me. I will certainly look to Seven Corners for broader coverage after my retirement because of Jona’s responsiveness.,5
Sevencorners,Very easy to work with the company. There is an adequate price for coverage plan options. A gentle reminder for updating the plan was also helpful. I am grateful that all questions were resolved through email without using the phone.,5
Sevencorners,They are very easy to quote and bind with.,5
Sevencorners,"We were on a trip to Italy in May, 2022. The day before we were to fly home we both tested positive for COVID. We had to quarantine in our hotel, unable to leave for anything and could not retest for a week. The experience cost us roughly $3000 in extra cost. We even bought the COVID insurance! We basically got $300 back and all that covered was the cost of the insurance! We have now told several friends who have booked their coverage with another company. Don’t waste your money with this company—they cover nothing.",1
Sevencorners,Your company is a criminal enterprise with no interest in taking up claims or fulfilling them. My mother had dental issues that erupted all of a sudden. This was the result of a car door hitting her. But your claims specialist made us hear so much fine print and denied our right to file claim. Your organization is a racket.,1
Sevencorners,I have used this service for years. I even had to use it for an accident and they came thru quickly and easily.,5
Sevencorners,"I check multiple providers for travel insurance and Seven Corners had the best coverage options and the best price.  Although I did not need to make a claim, they were in constant contact with me, reminding me of my upcoming trip, and providing tips for my insurance should I need to file a claim.",5
Sevencorners,Update now past the max 89 days needed and its not even in review.  It is still in received.Filed cancel for any reason with all supporting documents uploaded and even numbered with detail. Filed claim in early July its now October and its not even in review.   I was told customer advocate would contact me. After several attempts i did finally got someone.I asked about delay and said due to covid they are at least 100 days to review claim due to airline and covidWe are in year 3 with covid at this point as the cdc says time to live with it and this is what its going to. After 3 years its time to be staffed appropriately.  Airline issue was months ago. I understand but there will always be something in the travel industry hurricanes etc and should have staff to handle ebb and flow.Chat says agents unavailable over and over after going through their very long chatbox. Very frustrating.I will say when you finally reach somome they are polite and nice no issues there.Its just its time to be staffed accordingly.,2
Sevencorners,"This 5 star review is specifically for Hannah Imel who has been very helpful thru the entire process.I spoke to a Michelle from your claims dept. this afternoon and was very disappointed with her poor customer service.  Not only did she impart an ""I don't like my job and doesn't want to be here attitude"" but she kept on telling me that she did not know the answers to my questions.  It is unacceptable to have a frontline employee who is not knowledgeable and has a negative attitude representing Seven Corners in the claims customer service dept.  I also don't appreciate this type of service after holding on the line for approx. 15 minutes.",5
Sevencorners,No hickups this trip.  Good to have backup.,4
Sevencorners,I travelled for three weeks and took careOf myself and my health; so all went well.,5
Sevencorners,"Very helpful when I had an issue the customer services were able to sort it and so polite, just all around great service.",5
Sevencorners,"Though expensive, getting this travel insurance was easy and without a hitch.  It all happened smoothly.",5
Sevencorners,"We didn’t have to use any of the coverage, but the cost to coverage is reasonable.",4
Sevencorners,First time customer. Seven Corners documentation and policy selections are quite understandable and selection is straightforward. Have had to make several changes in coverage as trip planning has progressed. Ami is a very pleasant person. She was great to work with in making the last change and making sure I was aware of certain change constraints as the trip start date approaches.,5
Sevencorners,"“Stay Away!!!!” I had a heart attack in Egypt two days before my policy lapsed. I was so thankful that I had travel insurance to help with medical expenses as well as hotel and flight interruption.  I had a policy, it’s been six months now I have been calling providing all documentation required and still they ask for the same documents at least five times over.  I call my supposed dedicated claim advisor with no answer nor reply. I don’t even think “Maxwell Stutesman” is a real person. I am going to file a claim with the Oklahoma insurance board, as far as I can tell up until this point, it seems as if they are just a telephone bank. I highly recommend you find someone else to insure your travel needs!!!UpdateAfter placing this review, I finally got a phone call instead of a email that was asking for the same thing over and over again my issue was soon there after resolved. It took nine months, but they finally paid out the claim.",3
Sevencorners,"I really don't have anything to say, because I didn't have to use the insurance.During my 6-week stay in Germany, I didn't become ill, lost my baggage (I chose carry-on only), neither flight delays or cancellations, no catastrophic events (War in Ukraine is bad enough).I definitely will choose your insurance again, thanks to clear information and guidelines, continuous support via App and emails.",5
Sevencorners,"Horrible experience.  Steer clear of this company.Purchased a policy that was supposed to have coverage for trip interruption due to COVID (tested positive and couldn't fly home from the UK).  I called from the UK and let them know the situation. I filed a claim in June 2022 when I returned home (5 days late), provided all requested documentation.  Here it is mid-September, and I log on to the site to check the status of my claim and it is denied.  No communication as to why it was denied.  They also regularly remove negative comments from their FB page and negative reviews.  There rating was a solid 2 out of 5 a few weeks ago. Then this new review page gets posted on their FB page with mostly good reviews replacing all the horrible reviews they had.  NEVER again.  I've already filed a complaint with the Indiana Insurance Commission as well as my State's Attorney General.  One customer is starting a class action lawsuit against them and has contacted me for my info.UPDATE****  In response to your comment below, I have e-mailed your company multiple times and no one responds.",1

Sevencorners,Ami did an outstanding job in understanding my situation and resolving it to my complete satisfaction,5
Sevencorners,I have really bad and sad experience with Seven corners. They never pay the medical bills to the provider and they don’t reimburse the amount as well even though they promise that they will. They just keep fake promises. It’s all fake service. I just wasted my money on them.,1
Sevencorners,It got 4 because it was a good price for the coverage although we did not use it at all.,4
Sevencorners,"I didn’t need to use the insurance but it gave me tremendous peace of mind to have it as I traveled to a big conference on the other side of the world.Also, the woman who helped me was very knowledgeable and friendly",5
Sevencorners,"You are were very helpful, friendly and professional!",5
Sevencorners,"Extremely easy to deal with.  Fortunately, we didn't need the insurance!",5
Sevencorners,Seven Corners is an amazing company to work with. I booked trip insurance with them just before the pandemic and subsequently had to cancel the trip. A couple days ago the trip got rescheduled. They honored the original trip insurance policy and I'm covered on my replacement trip. Thank you Seven Corners!!,5
Sevencorners,"It was the most painful experience I have ever had in the US so far. Very dramatic. They still have not processed my paperwork for the doctors I have visited since last year and no matter how many times I called them, they are refusing to get it done. Every time I call, they say something different for not doing my paperwork... I am so sorry for the way they are dealing with customers. Also after 3 years of being their customer, they were unwilling to renew my policy because I was a Ph.D. student studying in the US and the country where I have born was Iran! After 3 years they said we cannot extend your insurance because you are from Iran!!!!!... This is horrendous...",1
Sevencorners,I received a cancer diagnosis a few weeks before we were scheduled to fly to Greece in April 2022.  I needed surgery and treatment in the following weeks and months. Swiss Air refused to refund our fare or even give us a credit unless we used it within a year which was impossible given our circumstances. I had purchased a policy from Seven Corners when we made our reservations and they honored our claim and refunded our airfare. It took a few months and,5
Sevencorners,"There is little to tell.  We insured our trip.  The representative we worked with was very good. We were satisfied with the terms, notifications, etc.  In the end, the trip presented no problems so there was no need to make a claim.",4
Sevencorners,"It was very reassuring to be able to guarantee that during these Covid times we were insured against at least part of a very expensive vacation -- at any time for any reason. Fortunately, we didn't have to use it, but the uncertainty was there all the way through. Thanks, Seven Corners!",5
Sevencorners,"I filled for travel interruption delay about two weeks ago, called to find out about status, and was told it would take up to 70 days plus for them to get back to me.This is abnormal response time and needs to be much shorter.",1
Sevencorners,"I didn’t have to use my travel insurance because things went smoothly, but I felt so reassured to have it available.",5
Sevencorners,This is the second time I have used Seven Corners to purchase travel insurance for international travel. It was quick and easy process to purchase online. In both cases we were fortunate to have no issues and did not need to request any assistance or make a claim. We will use Seven Corners again.,5
Sevencorners,Efficient service in buying the insurance.  We had no need to file a claim although Seven Corners did reach out to explain the process if necessary.,4

Sevencorners,I bought a travel Insurance with SevenCorners in 2020. Because of the pandemic I was unable to travel until October 2022 und SevenCorners was accommodating enough to reinstall my insurance for this 2022 trip.  I feel very thankful and think this company is outstanding.,5
Sevencorners,"My customer service representative, Shelley, was   extremely knowledgeable, courteous and just the best representative I spoke to regarding my John Hancock Gold issues.  My Policy ID no. is 50GJHTOH-100247.She should be a supervisor and receive a raise because she is that great an employee.  I'm really serious.  And she was very meticulous about travel dates to guarantee coverage and avoid issues.",5
Sevencorners,I had travel to Brazil in June and I bought Seven corners travel card. Unfortunately I have to use it since I got COVID. The treatment cost was about $65.00 (R$350.00). I sent all the information requested by 6/23/2022 and I followed up one month later without any feedback they answered me that The timing to turn around timeframe is 77 calendar days. Guess what: I have received no answer even after this ridiculous timeframe. I am glad at this point the expense I had in Brazil was very low and I could pay by myself. Imagine what will be if I had the pay a higher amount during my trip. I will never use this company anymore.,1
Sevencorners,I do not recomment this provider. Not reliable.,1
Sevencorners,Seven Corners has been wonderful to work with.  They are responsive and professional.,5

Your website was easy to navigate, and I did not have any issues with selecting the right plan to fit my needs.

I look forward to using Seven Corners for my next trip!",5
Sevencorners,"We obtained coverage through seven corners via ef tours for a school trip. My daughter tested positive for Covid on our preflight test the night before- this was April 14, 2022. We promptly contacted the company and sent in the proper paperwork with a copy of a positive test as well as the paperwork filled out by her pediatrician for the medical excuse. We were told turn around time would be 4-6 weeks. We have called and emailed multiple times with them saying they would “escalate the claim” when calling back to check on the escalation, they state they will escalate it again. This is now going on four months without a resolution.Update: I did finally hear back from a representative stating that they cannot find any of the documents that were submitted re: positive Covid test and the physicians letter advising against travel despite a previous email that the company had received them. I was able to pull the Covid results up from the portal, but unacceptable that after four months all the documents are now “lost” and we will now need to go back to the doctor’s office to once again have this paperwork filled out.",1

Sevencorners,"Stay away from Seven Corners! I purchased the Roundtrip Choice (AOS) plan from Seven Corners almost nine months ago for my trip from the US to the UK and France. My travel from the UK to France was derailed when France closed its borders to all tourists coming from the UK because of Covid. I bought a ticket back home to the US, and then sent all the receipts and information to Seven Corners, including screenshots of the news headlines about the border closing and all tourist travel being suspended. Nine months later, I still have not received any reimbursement from Seven Corners - the opposite - they closed my case instead! At first they sent automated e-mails just asking for the same documents over and over, and I kept re-sending them. No one could tell me what - if anything - was missing, only that I should keep re-sending the documents. And then finally they just closed my case. No one responds to my email follow-ups. When I call them, no customer representatives can provide me with any information - I've spoken to different representatives each time, and each one of them said they don't know the people reviewing my case, and there is no way to escalate or contact them. In the end, Seven Corners has wasted my time and money, has provided no helpful information, no reimbursement, and no way to escalate. It was an enormous waste of money and feels like fraud. I imagine Seven Corners will do the same to you as well - I would stay far away from them.Update: Seven Corners finally responded right after I posted this review. They are reimbursing me for my smaller claim, which I greatly appreciate (I'm now changing my rating from 1 star to 2 stars), but my larger claim is still closed and I have not heard any update about it.",2
Sevencorners,"We have been using Seven Corners for about 7 years now whenever we travel overseas. This goes for when we're traveling by ourselves and when joining an established tour group. We often mix the two experiences, starting ahead on our own, then joining friends who have booked with an arranged tour, and continue afterwards with our own itinerary. I have found Seven Corners to be much more economical than the insurance offered by the tour companies. I am also able to calculate our own nonrefundable expenses, and by coordinating with my credit card and health insurance benefits, purchase only what I really need. Only once in the past have we needed to call on the coverage, but the help we got has made the premiums well worthwhile. Based on our experience, I always trust Seven Corners and recommend them to our friends.",5
Sevencorners,"Update: a day after posting this review here and on Facebook I did receive a review of my claim and the payment has arrived. My rec for anyone else facing issues: wait until the 100 days have passed and then post about it in public places.____I purchased this travel insurance for a trip to Miami for a friend's wedding event in April. I specifically purchased this plan because it was recommended for its Covid coverage and throughout the pandemic I have worried about getting stuck while traveling and having to pay to extend a stay in a hotel to quarantine/get better.I did in fact get sick and tested positive for Covid half way through my trip. I submitted the claim in early May. It is now almost September and so far it seems no one has even taken a look at my claim. I am currently out over 1K for things that are clearly covered under the policy I purchased. What is the point of travel insurance if you can't use it when all goes wrong? I've called several times and they keep saying ""long processing times"", but at what point is this just stealing someone's money without providing the service promised?",1
Sevencorners,"I bought insurance for a trip to Central America.  However, a couple of days before I was to leave, I found out that due to heavy rain, roads were closed and there were mudslides.  I was able to cancel flights and accommodation so I didn't lose any money.  I tried to cancel the policy or find out if I could get credit for a future trip.  I called, was told to send an email which I did.  But I did not hear back.  The two stars reflects the poor communication as I never actually needed the policy.",2
Sevencorners,Its been a great service for starting out with an international journey.,5
Sevencorners,You have not responded to claims I entered over a month ago,1

Sevencorners,"I was hospitalised urgently in Poland during my trip. It was next to impossible to speak to anyone, horrible communication when I did. The hospital bent over backwards as your insurance company tried to use a loop hole to refuse covering any and all of my urgently required care which I could not afford - thus why I bought travel insurance in the first place. It ended with a Neurologist having to spend his entire day running around for me out of the goodness of his heart. He did not have time for this, had patients he could have been providing needed care to, and certainly was not reimbursed for his time. He ended up having to use his personal email to send documents in the end, which was quite inappropriate. I wouldn’t recommend seven corners to any of my friends or family, acquaintances, or many connections from work and humanitarian work, military or otherwise to ever use this service.",1
Sevencorners,I did not need to use this insurance but I was so grateful to have it and no they were there to help me.,5

They also say they'll email me an update every 3 weeks but haven't. They had the best policy I could find for my trip, but now I'm disappointed because there's several thousand dollars at stake - and I'm still waiting.",2

I’ve cancel 3 days before that news released because I cannot RENEW my daughter’s passport.  Seven Corners denied my claim because criteria is listed in the policy that they do not cover lost/stolen passport. This happened all the time when people travel abroad.

Sevencorners,"I had to call them twice over the phone and both times had someone live speaking with us within long wait, and they provided helpful and knowledgeable answers to my questions.  I would definitely go with them the next trip I plan.",5
Sevencorners,"Firstly, I was contacted by email by another individual, who never got back to me.  Then after my second contact I got a chance to get a hold of Sean.  He's very attentive and a professional. So, I'll keep in touch with him for future needs.  He's a great guy and we all can benefit from people like him.  Thanks",5
Sevencorners,Never ended up needing it but it was super easy to sign up and no stress. Recommend for any traveler and would definitely use again.,5
Sevencorners,Tomorrow it will be 8 weeks since I filed my travel insurance claim. I spent $11000 out of pocket and they tell me I have to wait 107 days from the date I filed the claim until I can expect a response. I still have 50+ days to go! I cannot afford to wait 107 days for $11000 - this is causing financial hardship. They were nice and helpful on the phone when I bought this insurance. I should have asked and gotten in writing how long I'd have to wait for my claim to be reviewed and get reimbursed - that is what really matters.,1
Sevencorners,"This is a typical insurance company that buries disqualifying caveats that virtually assures your claim will be denied. Read the ""small print"" before you choose this company. We made the mistake of choosing Seven Corners and on top of paying their premium it cost us an additional $1,000 dollars out of pocket to get home after our flight was canceled by Jet Blue. Don't make the same mistake!",1
Sevencorners,"I purchased trip insurance from Seven Corners for a family sailing trip in the Caribbean. We ended up having to reschedule the trip twice due to family calendars. Seven Corners was with us every step of the way and willingly adjusted our coverage period accordingly. Outstanding customer service, will definitely work with Seven Corners again!",5
Sevencorners,"rated 5, no option to skip rest of questions",5
Sevencorners,"I filed a claim over three months ago for a trip cancellation due to covid. I received a few initial emails apologizing for the delay due to an increase in claims. Then I received an email asking me to submit a bunch of documentation I had already provided. And since then…absolutely nothing. I am highly disappointed with the lack of response and drawn out waitEDIT: This company is a total scam. Over 4 months later, they tell me the last piece they need is a “physician’s statement” to verify my illness due to “new covid requirements.” Never mind that this was never mentioned previously and I didn’t see my physician as my illness was thankfully mild (but obviously still couldn’t travel due to CDC guidelines). I sent them my positive PCR test months ago, and apparently now that’s not enough? AVOID THIS COMPANY they will do anything they can to keep your money.",1
Sevencorners,"Seven corners has been a great insurance provider for my many international trips!My only suggestion is that they communicate more directly with their customers during the claims review and payment process. I have received very little communication after filing a claim, am left wondering when my claim is being processed, am unsure whether or not my claim has been approved until I see the reimbursement in my bank account. It would be helpful to receive more contact with a Seven Corners representative during the claims process.",4
Sevencorners,"My daughter and I got Covid midway thru our 2week vacation. We had Covid symptoms and went to a clinic (with no certified medical professionals) in Dublin Ireland  and  andstested positive. Called 7 corners & was told we needed the Covid test to be certified by a medical professional. Your website was not helpful to find a clinic with a doctor. We contacted many clinics and could not find one with this professional. We only had a short time to find a licensed medical professional and we’re unable to find one before our flight home. Thus, 7 corners rep told us we were ineligible for reimbursement. 7 corners did not help us find a certified medical professional and our efforts were also hampered by our Covid symptoms. Thus after spending over $1,000 for travel insurance for my daughter and me, we got no help and suffered loses for the hotel costs while isolating in hotels. Your company was unresponsive to providing the help we needed when we were sick and needed help!",1
Sevencorners,CORONO VIRUS IS NOT COVEREDIN MY OPINION WHEN GOVERNMENT RELAXED THE RESTRICTIONS. SO MEDICAL COMPANIES NEED TO COVER CORONO VIRUS FOR ATLEAST FULLY VACCIANATED PEOPLE.,4
Sevencorners,Peace of mind affordably when travelling.,5
Sevencorners,"We were very disappointed in Seven Corners’ complete denial of our claim for hotel expense loss due to the pandemic. We had purchased a “cancel for any reason” travel insurance policy. A trip cancelled due to Covid travel restrictions should be covered as a reason for cancellation.We had tried our best, acting in good faith, to avoid submitting any claim. We expended time and effort to send additional documentation. In the end, it appears that Seven Corners was never going to consider a settlement on any claim related to the pandemic. Seven Corners should have saved us valuable time and shattered hopes by denying the claim after our initial interaction since it’s clear now this was always going to be the outcome.We will not use Seven Corners for any future travel plans and will not recommend the company to any friends or associates.",1
Sevencorners,Very easy to complete purchase and easy to reach,5
Sevencorners,"Luckily, I didn't need insurance on this trip. But I was happy to know that I had it. I found it very easy to set up and the rates were competitive. I would use Seven Corners again.",5
Sevencorners,"Bad experience with claimI have received medical bills without knowing that my insurance has denied my claims. I did not receive any notice from SevenConers about this claim or the reason for this denial. After 2 months, I received medical bills sent from the clinic. After contacting with SevenCorners customer services, I realized that they need my medical records, only after I contacted them. I then went to the clinic again to ask the nurse to fax my medical records. However, the fax number did not work at all, even after we have checked it with SevenCorners several times. At last, we went to the clinic the second time, and they agreed for us to retain our medical records, and email them to SevenCorners (we had to go to the clinic in person because they do not email medical records to others).During those days, I contacted SevenCorners at least 6 times and they were not helpful at all. They did not tell me how to handle my claim efficiently, and their attitudes are very commanding on the phone. SevenCorners want the medical records from the clinic, so we did their job to help to get the medical records; they want the fax number from the clinic, we called the nurse to get their fax number for SevenCorners to find the sent documents. We were very, very upset about the whole experience.",1
Sevencorners,"This is my second time purchasing travel insurance through Seven Corners and I have never had such good quality customer service from an insurance company. I heard back quickly, everyone I spoke to was knowledgeable and helpful. On top of that, they were all so kind, I'm delighted with the service I received and will be purchasing from Seven Corners again when I need travel insurance.",5
Sevencorners,Team was very helpful and assuring when I was in another country whose ER was denying me treatment until I paid cash upfront. The team worked with me remotely to make sure I got the treatment I needed and that it was covered under their policy.,5
Sevencorners,It's reliable insurance,4
Sevencorners,I didn’t end up needing insurance but it was a close call since we did get COVID at the very end of the trip. It was nice to feel a sense of security while traveling.,5
Sevencorners,Everything has been great about the company except for one thing: I've been waiting 6 weeks now to hear about my claim. It's taking far too long to process my claim. It makes me worried it won't be processed.,3
Sevencorners,"Great value !! No complaints. Great sales support on the phone and coverage for wind surfing and kite boarding lessons. Once I paid for the policy it took a couple days to get a few questions answered, but all in all a great product. Did not need to use the insurance, so it was both peace of mind and required for some of my family’s activities.",4
Sevencorners,"Fortunately I did not have to use your service , so my comments are just based on the good service I received when buying the policy.",5
Sevencorners,"It was difficult to reach the claims department. When I did, the representative was pleasant and helpful, but it had been 1 month since my claim was submitted, and I was told they are so busy it might take up to 3 months to hear anything. While it is good for them that they are busy, I think I will look elsewhere next time. Maybe they need more employees?",3
Sevencorners,"I didn't need to make any claims, so it was easy. I don't know how that process would have gone.",5
Sevencorners,"Its been almost 3 months since i filed my claim, still no payment. when i call they say the average time to review is over 100 days. What good is insurance if you can't pay out on claims. It took them about 10 seconds to take my initial payment.",1
Sevencorners,Our experience with Seven Corners was excellent. Their medical policy was a late add to our trip and customer service was great. Very easy to work with and very cost effective.We will definitely have them in the mix for our next adventure,5
Sevencorners,"Very easy to get service from, when we needed to revise the dates of our travel (twice) due to Covid.",5
Sevencorners,"To be clear, I never needed to file any claim, so I cannot comment on that. But the purchase of this insurance was smooth and the customer support person I spoke to on the phone was exceptionally supportive, precise and thorough.",5
Sevencorners,"Certificate # 10RTC21-AOS-127794Filed claims for both trip and baggage delay 2 weeks ago with no response as of Aug 5, 2022.  It is disappointing to have the delays affecting my travel but to not acknowledge the claims is not acceptable.",1
Sevencorners,It has been months since I submitted my claim and all the responses I’ve been automated about needing more time. I don’t think my claim has even been looked at. Will not use this company again.,1

Their choice of Seven Corners to service their policies was sound.",5
Sevencorners,"This travel insurance company is really a scam, a complete fraud, DO NOT USE IT!!!I used 3 times for 3 different trips. Of course the first 2 times I was lucky enough that I didn't have to use it, so everything was perfect right??The last time, my kid got sick during our trip so I had some medical expenses abroad, once we got back to the US, I filed a claim and that is when they just don't answer anymore...it has been 2 moths and nothing...they only thing they say is ""Your assigned claims advisor will review them and contact"" but this just never happened....When they want to sell you something it takes 5 minutes to get the policy, but then when you need to file a claim....they just disappearI will contact BBB for sure....this cannot keep happening.",1

Sevencorners,"Update:They finally reimbursed the full claim and I’m very thankful to them. They had prompt response and processing after I posted my review here and at FB as communication was scant prior to that.I will recommend it since they reimbursed the whole amount of claim without putting any fight, but I wish, they were more communicative and accessible after the claim was submitted.Initial Review:AVOID this company at all costs!!!We submitted the claim after my hospitalization in Peru in April and so far, (it’s August), nothing came out of it! Haven’t received any communication since June! No response to Email inquiry and if you call, despite 20+ min wait time, customer agents are available to talk!Extremely regrettable to pour money into this scam! Please avoid!",4

Sevencorners,"The experience I have had has been a lack of communication with this company, poor customer service and no follow-up with regard to our claim.",1
Sevencorners,"As a rule the Seven Corners staff seem to enjoy their job. Most, it seems work from home, which I presume, improves their attitude. It is nice to interact with people that are happy.Seven Corners is based in Indiana which is great. So much better than trying to talk to someone in Asia.Oh yeah. They are competent, friendly and the call wait time is short!Obviously, their insurance product meets my needs, first.",5

Sevencorners,My parents have been purchasing Seven Corners for years for their travel to Canada. We used them and have had no issues.,5
Sevencorners,Very negative experience with John Hancock travel insurance administration by Seven Corners. Our original flight was cancelled proactively (notified the day before) by the airline due to a large snow storm.  The insurance claim was denied because the snow event happened the day before we were supposed to leave so was not in the period of our trip coverage.  The additional expenses this caused during  trip period were denied.  Buyer beware of their fine print!,1
Sevencorners,Excellent informative assistance !Hoping for the claim process to be as good!Thank you!,5

Sevencorners,"I have been with 7 corners for going on three years now! They have the BEST traveling coverage. They pay $50000 in case of death to fly your remains home. Luggage loss is just a plethora of concerns we all have when traveling abroad. They cover all those fears! Now they've added a  Seven corners app to your cell phone so you have all your info with you instead of having to be in front of a PC or laptop. Living in Luxor Egypt a 3rd world city. Seven corners is not limited to certain Hospitals here. But to ALL  hospitalization/healthcare! I'm 68 so your know I have to have the best care! They even include Covid hospitalization in your yearly policy coverage. $100,000 Wheres last year it was an added expense to the Policy. They just keep getting better and better to serve us travelers that have WANDERLUST hahahah",5

Sevencorners,"I booked this trip in the fall of 2019, with a leave date in July of 2020.  After careful consideration I decided to purchase travel insurance from Seven Corners.  Due to the covid epidemic the trip was postponed twice.  The customer service at Seven Corners was fantastic as they adjusted the departure dates for me each time.  My questions about coverage due to the possibility of coming in contact or coming down with covid while on the trip were thoroughly answered and new cover sheets were issued to me by email with a specific paragraph relating full coverage should I contract covid while on the trip. I would definitely use this company again.  Thanks to all!  It was a great trip.",5
Sevencorners,"It is an expensive insurance that simply does not deliver on its advertised services. Its partnership with a US insurance company provides too few care providers in the US to be useful. I will update my review if I get an update regarding the issue below, but I am strongly advising against it for now.I subscribed to the Liaison Travel Plus plan in January because it had a coverage guarantee for covid-related repatriation and because it came with a US insurance number (a must to visit any physician in the US).In February, while visiting New York, I fell sick and I tried to make an appointment at a physician in New York. Seven Corners provided a list of referrals after an initial phone conversation.- of the first 15 referrals, 10 had closed or moved and 5 did not accept the US insurance number that came with our Seven Corners coverage- I was able to make an appointment with the 16th one, only to discover that it had been a mistake on their side. I was told literally by the doctor's assistant: ""we usually never take this insurance because it is too much of a pain to get reimbursed"".I paid out of pocket instead and submitted a claim in March, which was acknowledged in April. It is now July and I have received no further message despite multiple inquiries. Phone calls do not go through, allegedly because the team is too busy with emergency cases.",1

I do understand that places are behind due to coronavirus, but they give you the impression that you are getting the runaround, and they don't even address you by name.",3
Sevencorners,"I had a good experience with Seven Corners. Our trip was rescheduled several times due to Covid-19 and international travel restrictions.

Sevencorners,"Competent advices, fast response.",5
Sevencorners,"Thankfully, we did not fall sick during our stay in the US. So, not in a position to offer comment on prompt claim settlement and other issues pertaining to actual execution of the contract.

Sevencorners,I didn't need to file a claim and had this insurance.,5
Sevencorners,"Very efficient and friendly. I used them because I needed a 60-day pre-existing medical window. They were the only ones who offered this and I'm glad they did.

Finally when I decided on a new trip they updated the original policy to cover that - and as the cost did not increase there was no charge.

But, our adult kids, with whom we traveled,  and a grandchild came down with Covid, while in Europe and, getting both information with respect to what was needed to rebook and get reimbursed for travel expenses, as well as receiving conflicting information about getting dr reports and certification of illness…in a foreign country was quite a hassle for them. It worked out in the end, but was stressful! Clearer contact information would have been helpful. as well as better information with respect to what constituted medical certification of illness.",4

Sevencorners,"I purchased travel insurance through Seven Corners. I recently had to cancel a trip due to a positive covid test and a death in the family. Despite having a death certificate and proof of the Covid test, my full claim was denied, and I only received the 75% CFAR amount. I have contacted this company appealing the claim amount several times with no success. Their Facebook page is full of negative comments from others who they have not paid claims. They have deleted all of my comments on their page, blocked me from commenting and deleted several other negative comments.  All of the negative comments about them have been deleted.   UPDATE FOR THEIR REPLY. Yes I cancelled before my trip when I was symptomatic for Covid and my mother-in-law was in hospice care awaiting to pass away. I cancelled on Monday Feb 21. I tested positive for Covid on Thursday Feb 24. My mother-in-law passed away on Friday Feb 25 after being in hospice for 2 weeks. My trip was scheduled for Feb 26. I suppose being symptomatic with Covid and awaiting a death in the family does not qualify. I have reported your company to my state attorney general, Indiana state attorney general and others.

He was extremely knowledgeable, helpful, thorough, and careful with his explanation of the policy coverage and exclusions.

We were fully compensated by the cruise company (with future cruise credit), but our hotel before the cruise was not.

But when we arrived at our destination and the minivan we had reserved was not available and renting one from another agency was going to cost $220/day, I was told that Rental Cars are not a valid trip interruption. Also, when the kitchen island in our Airbnb fell over and damaged one of our cell phones, I was told that cell phones are excluded from personal effects. How would I have known that there is a specific exclusion for cell phones?! Both of these seem like legitimate claims to me. Seems like travel insurance isn’t worth the cost.",2

When I calculated the cost of the insurance I needed, I included the cost of an airline ticket and a guided raft trip fee.  I was not told I had to cancel the entire policy to exercise the trip insurance policy, i.e., I could not cancel the airline portion of my trip and recover that cost through my trip insurance.  Instead, the Seven Corners insurance company rep told me I had to cancel the airline ticket and the raft trip fee to exercise the insurance policy (which i did not want to do).",1

Sevencorners,"I was contacting customer service because I needed an adjustment (increase) in our trip coverage. We had added to the trip since purchasing the policy last fall. I much appreciated the chance to get a call back (which was very prompt), as opposed to waiting on hold on the phone. Ami was so efficient and friendly and took care of everything.",5

Sevencorners,Filed a claim 2 weeks ago and haven’t heard a word,2
Sevencorners,"DO NOT GET THIS INSURANCE!I had to select Seven Corners specifically for my J-1 visa as requested by my employer. I had a positive experience with them 10 years ago so I was not worried. However things have changed significantly since then. I had to go through them for the past 5 years and they have always found a way not to pay anything. They take months to examine a claim. I currently still have a claim open from over year ago! And this is not the first time this happened. They ask for the same documents over and over again, tell you to contact doctors offices to request documents they also have already sent multiple times. You have to deal with a different person every time. You spend hours on the phone for nothing, and in the end, end up paying the full bills directly to the provider, who is, by this point quite upset. Things got so bad that I ended up getting another insurance in top of this one (since it was mandatory) over the past months. And guess what, I have had no problems with this other health insurance. They do what they said they would do when I signed up. My claims are reviewed within a couple of weeks. I don't have to send never ending paperwork. No more headaches!!! My advice: run away from Seven Corners. They will take your money. But they will not be there when you need them!",1
Sevencorners,"Upon talking to a representative of Seven Corners, she helped me pick the correct insura ce and start the policy immediately.  SUPER EASY!!!",5
Sevencorners,"I was desperate, I couldn't find a travel insurance for my partner who has a special situation and we were not able to find an insurance company in Canada.  He is an international student and have no access to public medicare in Quebec he doesn't have access to travel insurance from Canadian based travel insurance companies.  I found Seven Corners asked to be served online to see his eligibility and a quote.  DeAwna helped me.  In few minutes I got the quote, sent to my email with all the details.I sincerely hope we won't have to call for a claim, but definitely for next trip we will request your services",5
Sevencorners,"Well, what can I say - I didn't need to use the insurance on my trip, or the last trip, or the trip before that. I don't think it is a good luck charm but I might give it 5 stars if I got a 25% off coupon for my next policy",4
Sevencorners,"The young man that helped me, Tristin I believe, listened to me and understood my needs.  He was helpful and gave me complete information.Thank you.",5
Sevencorners,Sending a survey before responding to my claim puts me in an awkward situation. Your survey should be sent after claims have been reviewed for me to give valid feedback.,3
Sevencorners,"A most unpleasant experience.Being an immigrant from Russia I can at least to some extent understand why the company would decide to refuse to extend my policy with all the undeniably and unfathomably tragic events of the current year (although – in all honesty – it seems much closer to the practices of the Russian government: to deny services to those in need and dissociating themselves completely from the criminal actions), but SC could at least have informed me via an e-mail or a telephone call that such a decision had been taken instead of me fighting to find out the reason. On a personal level it seems to be very unethical and condemnable to act solely on the basis of nationality without any attempts for the person to at least redeem oneself or prove unrelated to the current events, discriminatory even. The cherry on the cake, of course, is not even to notify the client about such a decision having been taken – that would have made the whole experience less bitter.",1
Sevencorners,"Thanks God, I didn’t use it, but is good to have a insurance",5
Sevencorners,Hard to file claims. My coverage was denied after 180 days.,2
Sevencorners,One of our friends got sick and contacting the insurance was awful. They texted me like 4 days after the incident. I won’t recommend this insurance.,1
Sevencorners,My claims were filed in January and I am STILL waiting for a resolution. I have submitted every form requested by the company by email and to the website itself and they continue to send generic requests saying to reference previous document requests. This company just gives you the runaround and only responds in a timely manner when you leave negative feedback on social media platforms. AVOID Seven Corners. I will go back to Allianz because they resolve claims in a timely manner and do not scam their customers.,1
Sevencorners,Seven Corners is the expert for denying claims. They had denied my claims multiple times. The hospitals and myself are still dealing with Seven Corners until today.I want to seek some attorney's help to do whatever it takes to make Seven Corners to pay their parts on the claims.,1
Sevencorners,I felt I needed trip insurance (mainly health insurance) at the last minute (about 24 hours) before leaving for Germany.  Whoever I spoke to was able to explain what was available and the cost of and differences between the various policies. fortunately I did not have cause to make a claim.,5
Sevencorners,"They helped me fix my problem, but the attitude of the person that I was talking to could’ve been better",4
Sevencorners,"Fortunately, we did not have to file a claim as a result of our recent trip family of 11, ages 8 to 70, to South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana, but I was glad to have the security of the insurance.The representative I worked with was Heather Kleinschmidt.  She was willing to answer any and all questions I posed, even if she had to search for the answer and get back to me.  She was top notch.",5
Sevencorners,Nice and easy to navigate the site. Great price with quick results. I would recommend it to anyone who looking to buy travel health insurance!,5
Sevencorners,Very adjusting and helpful staff. Highly recommend Joshua!,5
Sevencorners,Service was good when I signed up.  Price reasonable for the trip.Glad I didn't have to use.  Also glad I went direct to them rather than using a broker.  Cuts out the middle person if you have to file a claim.,5
Sevencorners,"I have used Seven Corners for years and they have always been delightful to work with.  During Covid, policies I had purchased previously were extended for almost two years.  I also had no trouble getting a refund after trip price had been lowered.  Employees have always been helpful and courteous.  A joy to work with a company that appreciates their customers.",5
Sevencorners,I wish all my mistakes was rectified as quickly and politely as this was.,5

Sevencorners,I filed a claim on the following and have received a partial refund and then an email saying I was denied.  There are not details of what was accepted and what was declined.  Very confusing process and it took over 3 months to address from time of filing.1RTB21-AOS-110320,3
Sevencorners,"My son has severe food allergies and we wanted to find a travel insurance plan that would cover us in case of emergency. Thank God we did not need the insurance plan, but before we signed up the insurance company explained exactly what would be covered and what to do if we would need it. Very happy.",5
Sevencorners,"While I understand that the coverage does not include ""routine care"", not having essential medicines on an extended trip overseas is not ""routine"". I was forced to go to a local clinic and pharmacy, pay the full costs since I am not a member of Portugal's health care system, in order to get essential medicines as US prescriptions are not recognized here. Given international drug restrictions, I could not bring four months of medications in from the US even if I could get that much in a US pharmacy, which is also impossible on US Medicare. My claim for these doctors and pharmacy visits was denied - after months of waiting for the claim to be reviewed.Needless to say I am a very unhappy customer.",1

Great follow up and support.Details:DeAwana followed up very promptly with a quote for the best plan for my daughter traveling to Spain. A covid disruption was one of my main concerns and she recommeded a policy that cover costs associated with Covid. She also followed up within hours with two issues.My first issue was that I could not print the insurance card. DeAwna fixed the error I made with a misspelled email address.The second issue was, that my daughter tested positive in Madrid. The person on the phone from seven corners told me I was not covered for quarantine costs. I contacted DeAwana who clarified that indeed there is a $250 per day coverage up to $2,000 with the Rondtrip plan.That was a great follow up for a $125 policy. Thank you, Thank you,  DeAwana.

Sevencorners,"I would give this company zero stars if I could. I cancelled my trip to Mexico on February 7, 2022. I had purchased cancel for any reason coverage. I submitted all documents that were requested at that time. Every two to three weeks, Seven Corners requested more documents to verify my cancellation. On April 13th I received notification that my claim was being deactivated unless I submitted the documents requested. So once again, I emailed all the documents. Finally on June 6, 2022, I called to ask about my claim. The agent said she would expedite my claim. Finally on June 24, 2022, I received notice that my claim would be processed but at 75% of the cost of the trip because I cancelled because of COVID. The email said to allow 10 days for the payment to be processed. This may be a great company, until you have to file a claim. Buyer beware!",1
Sevencorners,"I filed a claim due to our return flight back to the US being delayed such that we missed our connecting flight back to Boston.  After 3.5 months waiting for the claim to be processed, I received a rejection for the claim.  Their reasoning was that the second flight arrived ahead of schedule in Boston.  They completely missed that our first flight was delayed and we were not able to get to the second flight and needed to spend the night in Queens in New York, despite ample documentation.  So then I call the phone number that is listed if I have any questions and I am told that I will need to file a formal appeal to reexamine the claim.  The claims department can not address it on the phone  How long now?  I was told maybe another month.  I guess you only learn how good or bad an insurance company is if you have a claim,   My claim was a small one, as the airline provided the hotel for us.  It was just for meals and some misc. items.",1
Sevencorners,"Very helpful,. and quick to send emails with documents. Excellent customer service",5
Sevencorners,You need to increase coverage amounts as people age. If you finally have the time and money to travel overseas it’s too bad insurance coverage is so limited.,4
Sevencorners,"The person I spoke to was great! Friendly, helpful, took care of my request.",5
Sevencorners,"Company was quick to answer the phone, maybe 15-second wait time. I gave brief explanation and was directed to another person, with zero wait time. Explained what I needed and was completely satisfied and with a new policy in hand. Total time from dialing to hanging up was 20 minutes. Unheard of, especially on a Monday morning. You have a customer for life!",5

Sevencorners,I didn't use the health insurance provided by Seven Corner. So cannot rate it according to experience in services.,3

Sevencorners,"Great personal, professional service. Outstanding follow up with people that care. I will be using them again in 3 months.",5
Sevencorners,"The only serious problem I noticed with Seven Corners is how it describes the Trip Cancellation benefit on its website and in the some of the documents (e.g. Travel Insurance Coverage Letter) it sends to customers after a policy is purchased.  With the RoundTrip Economy plan I purchased, the language used is ""Trip Cost up to a maximum of US $20,000"".  This is needlessly confusing and potentially misleading.  The Trip Cancellation Coverage limit is the specific dollar amount entered by the customer on the website during the purchase process.  This dollar amount (in my case $4000 per traveler) is the amount that should be shown on the website and in all documents sent to the customer at all times so they always see exactly what their coverage limit is.I've purchased travel insurance through other insurers in the past and they have always been crystal clear about coverage limits.  I see no reason why Seven Corners shouldn't do the same.",3

Sevencorners,Was easy and affordable. Have bought twice now with no issues but thankfully haven’t had to use it yet.,5
Sevencorners,"I purchased a policy recently from Seven Corners.  The customer service representative (Joshua De Jong) was very helpful in answering my policy questions.  He was courteous, professional and most importantly informative.  I even recommended him to a friend.

Sevencorners,Very efficient application process. Documents got easily approved. Will purchase again in the future.,5
Sevencorners,"I was a customer of the Seven Corner health insurance policy and my policy ended a week or two ago. I wanted to renew the policy and reached out to their customer service on the phone for their ""help"". Turned out that they don't offer me the policy anymore because of my country of origin.

Sevencorners,"I am still not convinced this isn't a scam, everything takes so long to process, and nobody ever has any answers. Their hope I believe, is to move so slowly and request the same information in different ways you just decide to quit. If you have nothing else to do, buying this insurance will work for you.",2

I purchased a Cancel for Any Reason policy, canceled that trip in February, filed a claim immediately. It is now mid June and still no payment from them. In the beginning I was told 30 days on payment of claims. Then later I was told over 90 days! We are now at 4 months with little to no communication from them!

Sevencorners,"I canceled my trip as my mother was at a critical stage with her leukemia and I am her primary caregiver.   Also, my husband was finishing treatment for prostate cancer so we could have filed a claim for that reason too.  I did the claim so as not to burden my husband with all the claims submission work. . Additionally, I purchased the ""cancel for any reason"" as a ""just in case"" our destination had an uptick in Covid at our destination & did not want to risk going.  I thought I had covered my bases.    I was told that either one of the health reasons were covered & I did not need to file 2 claims as both of us were covered by either health issue & one claim was sufficient.  Both my husband & I had purchased this same plan.  I filed a claim on April 8th.  I actually talked with an agent as I filled out the form to be sure I did it correctly and submitted all the info including letter from the Dr., and receipts on my credit card as proof of payments {which took an enormous amount of time as I had to cover all the other purchases on my cc statement & my personal information on every page that I then copied & submitted) , a letter from the travel company stating that they have a ""no refund"" policy & no future credit towards another trip. Because of their policy, the travel company advised us to get travel insurance & gave us the company that they recommend who is reputable & responsive. When I asked the Travel Co. to write a letter for this claim, they asked if I had gone with their recommended insurance company as claims are processed & paid within 30 days.  I am so sorry I had not used the company they recommended.  I am having the same problems with Seven Corners that all the bad reviews have covered.  Great service when you purchased the policy but horrible when you make a claim.   Long waits on phone trying to reach a representative if you even get through. No returned phone calls after leaving my number on recorded message that said they would call me back & keep me in order of the calls received. Excuses that they are so backlogged so all claims take 90 days ect.  In over this 2 1/2 month period,I received a digi-sign document on May 1, 5, 10 & the last one June 13 that was THE SAME CLAIMS forms I had already filled out and submitted via fax. I was able to get through twice in May & asked why I was getting these forms & told that it must be a mistake that they had all the documents & the claim was being processed & not to be concerned. ( On April 19, I received an email saying the 13 pages were received  & a claims advisor would contact me if any more info needed which never happened).  When I received the one on June 13, I opened it again and ran my cursor over the pages  just to see what would happen.  On each line of the form including my name & case number, OPTIONAL displayed.  Really!! You send a Docu-sign claims form repeatedly but it's optional to fill in the information????   After waiting on the phone for 40 minutes, I was told the same thing.  They don't know why I received it, there were no notes that they needed more info, & it was pending.  and maybe it was a computer problem on their end!  Really!!!  I said this is more than just some glitch and they needed to find out from someone in charge what was going on.   I'm still waiting to hear back from that ""someone""   I tried another number that was given me and it was a recorded message saying I was being offered a medic alert device as a special offer!  I'm fed up!10 RTC21-AOS-102317  I went with this company because of an article I read in Forbes.  Can't believe this!",1

Sevencorners,"Seven Corners insurance is as close to fraud as I've ever experienced. I purchased this insurance for a stay in the United State hoping to not have to use it. Unfortunately, due to circumstances outside of my control, I had to. I wish I never had.I was extremely diligent with keeping Seven Corners in the loop every step of the way, and they assured me that they had me covered as long as a followed the steps they outlined, which I did. Weeks later when bills began to roll in, I discovered that was all a lie.Seven Corners has denied all of my claims and is trying to stick me with $20,000 in hospital, doctor, and test bills -- prices which even the doctors involved said ""could not be possible"" given what the visits entailed. Seven Corners blamed the doctors' staff and claimed visits were 'missing information' or were for reasons other than the actual purpose of my visit to the doctor. I've gone on to spend countless stressful hours appealing my denied claims and sourcing information/documents to submit to Seven Corners to support my claims (something that is their job). If I am stuck with these bills I will have no choice but to declare bankruptcy.I feel completely abandoned by Seven Corners -- a company I paid a hefty price ($1000) to be insured. They have completely lost my trust and you should avoid them at all costs because they're going to stick you with the bill no matter what.The people that run this company should be ashamed of themselves. They abuse the trust of the people who they claim to protect.Certificate # 3ENAPT21-100161",1

Sevencorners,Thank God I did not need to use their services when I was abroad. Having their travel insurance but my mind at ease for they were extremely helpful five years when I had a bicycle in Israel.,5
Sevencorners,Great initially.  When we needed to extend our coverage we were required to add 5 days when we only needed 2 days.  Unnecessary and disappointing. Why charge the existing customer more than necessary?,4
Sevencorners,My daughter & I were so pleased with Seven Corners.  There was excellent customer service & communication.  We felt so protected during our trip.  I hope we have the occasion to use them again.,5
Sevencorners,"Great service, prices, and coverage.",5

Sevencorners,It’s been months since my claim and I have gotten road block after road in processing. I call and have m been able to speak to several  people about my claim but never my actual claim rep.They keep requesting same information that is already attached to original claim  like I was instructed.They can’t seem to connect claims and read notes well enough from their own reps to get it processed.Very frustrating,2
Sevencorners,"DeAwna was incredible on each of my phone calls !!Always very polite and Professional. A great listener as I had many questions and she was always very patient. I would highly recommend your company because of my wonderful experience with DeAwna. I found out about SevenCorners as they were highest rated in "" Forbes Magazine ""and will continue to call DeAwna every time we travel several times a year. Thank You DeAwna",5
Sevencorners,I filed a claim and the claim rep stated that my claim would be reviewed within a week. I waited 2 weeks and called because I havent heard anything yet and the claim rep said it takes up to 98 days to review my claim.  A claim shouldn't take 3 months before it get reviewed. Never will I use your company again.,1
Sevencorners,"While I did not end up needing to use the insurance and can't comment on the claim submission process, I had a great experience with purchasing my plan. I had several questions so I called and the associate I spoke with, DeAwna Bailey, was incredibly helpful and even sent me an email confirming the details. When I had questions regarding the plan and called back the next day, DeAwna reviewed the details again and helped me through the purchasing process. Great customer experience for me!",5
Sevencorners,"Buying a policy was really quick and easy! The sales staff were extremely friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Will definitely be buying a policy again next time I go on a trip.",5
Sevencorners,They take too long to get back to you regarding claims. They tell you to wait MONTHS for a review and then when the day comes they make you wait more. They never answer the phone or emails. TERRIBLE SERVICE! I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND. You can see my last review below in march and they yet have done something about it.,1
Sevencorners,Very easy to communicate and I had to upgrade my coverage and they were very prompt and helpful.,5
Sevencorners,"They were very pleasant when they sold me the policy, but my trip was cancelled due to COVID and I have been trying to get them to respond for more than 6 months.  They keep putting me off via email and will not return phone calls.  My travel agent reached out to them and they would not respond to her either.  I would not recommend them in the future based on the very unprofessional way they are treating me.",1

Sevencorners,"I advise anyone thinking of getting insurance from Seven corners or John Hancock ( apparently they are the same as seven corners now) to avoid them if possible.They are super responsive when purchasing insurance however, when it comes to processing claims they give you a 90 day window. Well 90 days have past now I am told it will take another 30-90 days to process.I have friend who purchased from other travel insurance companies and received their in 30 days.Customer service is nice but they just keep giving you the same script that you need to be patient.I have purchased many policies from John Hancock I the past and this is the first time I needed it. They really failed in customer experience and I will be buying my next plan from another insurer.",1
Sevencorners,"We chose Seven Corners because of friend recommended their policies. I do believe their website can be a little hard to use at times, but otherwise they were great to work with. I did work with a customer service for a while and she was wonderful. We had no issues on our trip so we didn't have to use the insurance.",5
Sevencorners,Filed a claim over 3 months ago and reviewed request for additional information but no mention of what additional needed.  Submitted additional info and now 6 weeks later just the sound of crickets.,2

I would definitely recommend John Hancock & Andrea for travel insurance needs!",5
Sevencorners,I would like your company to know how helpful Laura O. has been to me the past weeks.  Laura went above and beyond to help me rebook travel insurance I was to use for a trip in January 2022 and unfortunately cancelled due to the pandemic.

Sevencorners,Web site did not work when I needed to extend. Had to make an overseas call.,4
Sevencorners,So many coverages and not clear as to what some terms meant. Submitted small claim and I am told 100 days to resolve. This feels like a scam to have my money to float in your account. 30 days max and a claim should be processed.,3
Sevencorners,Great customer service with honesty & integrity,5
Sevencorners,The customer service representative when I called was very helpful.,5

Sevencorners,When I called to purchase insurance the response time was excellent but when I called with questions I couldn't reach a live person and it took too long to receive call backs. No one even came on your chat line and I was holding to chat with someone for over an hour. Thank God we did not have a problem while traveling because I was concerned about your customer service given your inability to answer the phone or chats or to return calls on a timely basis.,2
Sevencorners,Words can’t explain how satisfied I am for the quick and friendly service I got thanks much,5
Sevencorners,It was a peace of mind to find out that Seven Corners offers insurance for our aging parents visiting from overseas.,5
Sevencorners,"I'm living abroad and purchased a 6 month insurance plan with Seven Corners. I purchased the optional ""hazardous activities"" coverage knowing I'd be mountain biking. The policy's definition of hazardous activities includes mountain biking as example, so you'd think it'd be covered. Nope. Unfortunately, I only found this out after injuring my shoulder in a mountain bike accident after waiting months for a response from Seven Corners. A complete waste of time and a lot of money.Reply: Yes, but then it says see definitions in Section 9, which says mountain biking. The policy is written to be intentionally misleading.The Policy provides under Section 9.

Sevencorners,"I purchased travel insurance - including the Cancel for Any Reason (CFAR) rider - for a February trip that had to be cancelled due to Covid. I filed the claim on February 9 and was informed at that time the claim should be processed in thirty days. Well, 30 days came and went...and then the Seven Corners claims department said it would take NINETY days to process. The ninety days came and went with no updates, so I posted a couple of comments on Seven Corners' Facebook page stating my intention to start a complaint with my state's Insurance Department. The Seven Corners social-media team evidently prodded the claims department to get cracking - I received two communications within a few days stating that the claim was finally being processed, and then on May 16, a note that payment for about 93% of the reimbursement amount I requested would be mailed, which I could expect to receive within ""ten working days."" Well...once again, the time stated has come and gone, and no check in hand. Once again, I'm having to contact Seven Corners and state my intention to pursue legal remedies over their foot-dragging.",1
Sevencorners,"Unfortunately my families flights to Italy were cancelled, and for good measure Alitalia then went out of business. Fortunately having purchased both medical and bankruptcy cancellation insurance from Seven Corners I was  able to file a claim with a pre printed form, was told due to their backlog it would take 5-6 weeks, was asked 1 follow up question and was reimbursed completely for business class tickets. Not sure how much more one could expect from an insurance company, thankfully no one needed to see if their medical coverage was as good.",5
Sevencorners,"Josh de Jong was very helpful in filling in some details of our insurance coverage, and gave us his full attention.",5
Sevencorners,"Amy and Jonna were awesome.  Amy helped me understand my current policy adjust and then discuss why I might want to upgrade it.  Amy transferred me to Jonna who completed the purchase of my new policy and sent me back to Amy to cancel my previous one.  This could have been hours of back and forth and wait times but both ladies knowledgeable, efficient and FRIENDLY.  Thanks AMY and JONNA!  You made my day.",5

The worst experience even that I contacted them the same day the accident happened. They told me to pay and later on I could submit my claim.  Do not believe you are ¨covered¨, they will do whatever not to pay and reimburse.",1
Sevencorners,"I have used several different travel insurance agencies for trips.  I was not happy with my most recent choice and someone recommended Seven Corners.  Seven Corners were very easy to contact; I had the same agent throughout the process and she even returned phone calls!  Returning a phone call seems like a no-brainer, but I can tell you from past experience with other agencies that this is not the case.  Other travel insurance companies have a recorded message when you call that states “due to higher call volume….” In some instances you are not even given the option of leaving a voice message requesting a call back.  Those days are gone!  I am committed to using Seven Corners going forward.",5

Sevencorners,"I was supposed to go on a trip with various other travelers that was cancelled earlier in the year, and we all had the same insurance coverage. We all filed the same claim, and yet seven corners decided to give some of us an 100% refund and others a 75% refund for no apparent reason. When I complained about this, they told me I can file an appeal that could take an extended amount of time to be settled and essentially stated that just because I disagree with their decision does not mean that it will change. It seems highly disorganized, random and unfair that people who went through the same process and situation would receive different refunds. No one should have to go through such an abundant amount of effort due to a mistake on the part of seven corners. A lot of money down the drain due to their sketchy and extended process.",1

I was trying to go back and recapture my insurance policy for travel post-Covid and I did not have the information.

It was a no-hassle experience and I will continue to Seven Corners for my future travel insurance needs.,5

Covid-19 again caused the trip to move--to 2022.  I called to update my travel information and to also include information not previously provided due to Covid. Yesterday (05/20/22) I called the customer service line and spoke with Eva. She was very helpful and answered all my questions. She transferred me to Amy who completed the process and asked several times if I had all my questions satisfactorily answered. Both were extremely helpful and delightful to speak with.

Sevencorners,Very friendly and helpful.  Extremely professional,5
Sevencorners,"Sure, they took our money perfectly well over a year ago. In December, our destination country shut down, flights canceled, etc so we filed a claim. I submitted all the information requested with proof of loss, etc. In February, they asked for the EXACT same information, which I submitted again. In March I escalated, in April I escalated, in May I call every week now asking for a status. No communication, no replies over email, and the status constantly says pending. I guess my $11k loss isn't important to them, nor my satisfaction as a customer.How good is travel insurance when they sit on your qualified claim for 6 months? Not only that, but when I call, I get a run around, and emails go unanswered. I get better service from fast food restaurants.",1

Sevencorners,"Claims processing time was too long, > 76 days to process a claim. The requirement to provide bank statements of payments to EF Tours, including multiple automatic drafts (from years ago due to COVID trip delays), to prove payment is ridiculous.  The statement from EF Tours providing proof of payment should be sufficient, since EF Tours is who collected and paid the fee. Customer service reps could not even escalate a call because next level resources were not available.",1

I also didn't mention the tragic news, so they just made the change as a matter of normal policy. The conversation lasted 5 minutes. Such corporate flexibility and understanding feels very rare.",5
Sevencorners,"My experience with Seven Corners was refreshing because I actually got to talk to a real person who didn't resemble a bored robot!  Riley was super helpful and professional - and friendly.  The thing that really sold me on her and Seven Corners was when I emailed with a couple of questions AFTER I purchased a policy and Riley got right back to me.  It's not usually as easy to get answers once said company has your money.  This experience was different. It gave me faith that if I end up having some kind of a travel problem, I have a specific and helpful person to contact.",5

I do recommend Seven Corners travel insurance for their amazing customer service.",5
Sevencorners,"We were required to purchase travel ins by our location. The rep made the coverage effective the date after I called. I wasn't traveling for 3 weeks, but I didn't question it. Our location changed their rules BEFORE we traveled and I asked to cancel our policy and was told I missed my window. I kept being referred to the plan document... Had I known about their 10 day change rule I would have never allowed them to make the coverage effective so far before my travel date. Shelley Graves, Service just kept telling me to look at the plan document. She had no want to look into why my coverage was made effective so early, and clearly how I wasn't informed properly by the company that I would not be able to cancel.",1

Sevencorners,"I fortunately havent yet needed to use my insurance, but my experience with renewing it was consistently a bit challenging. The site wouldnt let me renew my own and i needed to reach out to an adjuster. The person assigned to me was slow to respond, like beyond the expiry which felt stressful. I also never got a response to a question i asked 3 times.Overall its not a huge deal, but it makes me wonder how challenging it may have been to make a claim!",3
Sevencorners,Didn't have a claim. But communication was great and easy.,5
Sevencorners,Great support. I was assisted very well.,5
Sevencorners,I never had to use my insurance so have no idea if the service was good but the agent I worked with was knowledgeable and helpful.  He answered all my questions,5
Sevencorners,Absolutely the best customer service - quick and efficient resolution of concerns.,5
Sevencorners,"TRISTAN SCHILLING is without a doubt the most professional, conscientious and  exceptional agent I have ever encountered.      From the first telephone call, when he explained the policies to us to the present, when I am now submitting a claim.....Tristan has been unbelievably kind, patient and knowledgeable.....He always returns calls, is more than patient, as well as being helpful beyond words!        It is such a pleasure to do business with such a terrific individual.       Just on the basis of this agent I would highly recommend Seven Corners insurance.....he such a wonderful ASSET to this company !",5
Sevencorners,"Love Severn corners!My guy goes fishing with very expensive gear that he travels with and goes deep in the remote Everglades to fish,It gives me peace of mind that his gear and trip is insured and if he is hurt while out of network he will have coverage.Thanks!",5
Sevencorners,So easy to update my travel dates. Great customer service,5
Sevencorners,This policy was never used as this writer was unable to travel after covid restrictions stopped travel plants.Insurer did not offer a refund.,1
Sevencorners,"Submitted a claim by email following all guidelines, have not received any response besides an automated reply for 5 days.  Submitted a follow up email after 5 days, again no response for another 3 days.  So I called and waited on the line 25 minutes and got to an answering service.  They took my information and said they will forward my inquiry to the ""customer advocates"" (how pretentious) who will call me back in 1-2 days...Ridiculous.Edit:  The day after my phone call I received an email from a Seven Corners Senior Customer Advocate that processing of my claim (a simple doctor's visit and prescriptions) will take 91 days (3 months!) ""because of the large volume of claims""...Once again, ridiculous.",1
Sevencorners,Easy one on one explanation over the phone. Good customer service attitude. 2nd time user. 👍,5

Sevencorners,Joshua was very knowledgeable and helped with all of my questions and concerns. I had never gotten travel insurance or traveled internationally before; he put mybworrris to rest. I will definitely use Seven Corners in the future.,5
Sevencorners,"I worked with Joshua De Jong in purchasing travel insurance for an upcoming trip to Italy.  I started the process on a chat line where Joshua answered all my questions completely and in a timely manner.  After I decided to purchase the policy, Joshua had all the confirmation paperwork emailed to me.  It was a very efficient process.  Joshua did a super job.Robert F.",5
Sevencorners,Concerns over scheduling and itinerary s. Not to mention baggage theft and covid testing,3
Sevencorners,Didn't file a claim. The buying process was straightforward and I have contacted an agent through chat that actually got me to a live person. My main issue was I cannot extend the insured days after I start the trip. So if I wanted to make my trip longer even by one day I don't have the flexibility without buying a whole new policy. I also would like options to increase coverage amount for COVID quarantine related expenses.,4
Sevencorners,"I appreciated the manner in which Seven Corners kept me informed regarding my travel with a variety of updates, reminders and travel tip.  I had never experienced that before with the other travel insurance providers I have used in the past.  Thankfully, we did not need to make any claims from our recent travels, but this attention to service would, I hope, extend equally to travel exigencies that might require the filing of an insurance claim.",5
Sevencorners,"We were looking for coverage for hotels/meals should we test positive for Covid before returning to the U.S.  The agent for Seven Corners understood what we were looking for...and not looking for. Fortunately, we tested negative so the coverage went unused.  Should the same need arise, we would again turn to Seven Corners",5
Sevencorners,user friendly,5
Sevencorners,"The gentleman (didn't catch his name) was so helpful and thorough, solved my issue and was so pleasant doing it, thanks!",5
Sevencorners,He was very helpful and saved me a lot of time.Thanks,5
Sevencorners,Never needed help but felt safe in knowing it was there if needed,5
Sevencorners,You were doing fine until you kept sending me reminder emails that my coverage was up.,3
Sevencorners,Joshua deJong followed up on my incomplete application for travel insurance. I was days away from a long planned trip to Europe and hesitated because of the price tag. What I really wanted was coverage if I experienced delays because of COVID. I wasn’t worried about lost bags. He heard my concerns and offered a policy that did exactly what I wanted for a more affordable price. It was a win/win outcome. I left for my trip knowing I was covered for the most troublesome scenario.,5
Sevencorners,"I would give them 4.5 stars if I could, but if I have to go for one or the other, I'll go for 5.I booked through one of their agents, who was extremely courteous and helpful. The entire process was very easy.The only deduction is that,  I misspelled my own name on the application (don't judge!). When I tried to resolve this problem through the agent who had previously been so helpful, I got no answer when I called and no response to an email. When I called their general customer service number, the problem was resolved immediately. I was just disappointed in the agent. Seven Corners in general was great.",5
Sevencorners,"Great customer support. Fast and easy to ""talk"" with an agent who was very helpful, patient, and knowledgeable.",5

Sevencorners,I actually purchase the policy for the medical insurance option but was pleasantly surprised to realize it also involved trip cancellation or interruption in my case there was real chaos at airports and I had delays changes in itinerary loss of baggage and although the total was not more than $400 it was really helpful to have this insurance in place,5
Sevencorners,Is hard to get in touch with an agent here in USA I no want to imagine how well be from a foreign country; thanks that we wasn’t need,2
Sevencorners,"Joshua was not only super friendly, he was an expert on giving me the information I was looking for and made the purchase easy for us.I highly recommend Seven Corners and will share it with my friends",5
Sevencorners,"Good insurance! Especially with Covid, I found that the Traveler Liaison Plus option gave me peace of mind. It's very easy to use and set-up. Filing a claim could be slightly easier since it does involve filling out forms that could have been automated vs. doing it more manually in .pdf (although glad it's all still electronic).",4
Sevencorners,Very helpful after a frustrating day on hold.,5
Sevencorners,"Joshua DeJong was very informative in the insurance programs available us regarding our upcoming trip to Europe.  He was able to secure a cost for recommended coverage during the same conversation, and we bound the coverage immediately.  He send us the insurance contracts, and offered to assist with other travel insurance needs.  Great honest informative experience with Joshua!!  Dave and Karen",5
Sevencorners,"You buy insurance hoping never to have to use it. That's what your insurer hopes, as well. I purchased 'cancel for any reason' insurance for an upcoming trip and as luck would have it, I had to cancel my trip. I filed a claim a month ago and got a confirmation a week later that they had received it. Since then nothing. When I called customer no-service, I was told that it can take 91 days for them to respond. This must be the legal limit, although they couldn't tell me what the legal limit was. I am going to file a complaint with the BBB since other people are having the same struggles with this company. I won't use them again.",2
Sevencorners,"Josh De Jong is great to work with, he is super quick in answering my questions and requests. Purchasing a policy is easy and clear. I have not needed them for claims yet.",5
Sevencorners,Getting help with a claim is difficult. I have been waiting for 3 weeks trying to get them to even initialize the refund I need. Great service as long as you don’t need it!,2
Sevencorners,Buying and extending policy was easy.luckily I never made a claim so I can’tComment on that. I will use them again.,5
Sevencorners,Josh De Jong was so helpful with the purchase process. I had to change my policy and he made this very easy.,5
Sevencorners,"The rep, who I talked to was so nice and had all the information I needed.",5
Sevencorners,"I've always been Very Satisfied and have used them for years.However Right Now I'm awaiting a claim filed on 3/4/22 and have been told it will take 84 days to be processed.Since I have a terminal disease, first symptoms started showing in 08/21, the other outstanding policy I currently have, a claim also be filed as there is no way I can take the trip. Heaven knows when I'll see action on both policies.  These policies were purchased literally Years ago, before covid 2020.",3

Sevencorners,Quick response to questions and very helpful and professional.,5
Sevencorners,After having the service for 2 years I had an incident where I needed to go to an emergency care Center in NY.  I handed them my paperwork from seven corners and rushed into the back for treatment.  3 months later I started receiving emails requiring I supply my primary travel insurance paperwork.  As a Canadian I did not have any ‘primary’ coverage.  It took multiple emails to convince seven corners that there wasn’t any other insurance.  Finally the emails stopped.  So frustrating,2
Sevencorners,Josh was very professional & every time I called he helped in answering all my questions as he is very knowledgeable. He made the insurance purchase a seamless transaction. I will definitely recommend Josh to all my travel industry colleagues.,5
Sevencorners,"Very helpful, kind and courteous. Appreciated the info",5
Sevencorners,"The agent that helped me (Josh De Jong) was very helpful! He broke down the differences in travel insurance plans in a way that made me feel a lot more comfortable traveling in the world we live in today. There was so much peace of mind in knowing if something bad happened, it would be taken care of. Thank you Josh for your help!",5
Sevencorners,Joshua De Jong was very helpful in finding the right policy that suits our needs.I would recommend him to anyone needing travel insurance.,5
Sevencorners,"Josh DeJong answered the phone, not a computer. Then he took the time to answer all my questions explaining the coverage in detail. As it is more pricey than other travel insurance, he assisted me to understand the merits of this insurance. Unless I need to use it, I’ll never know. But I feel secure with the policy I bought. Thank you Jason.",5
Sevencorners,"I was using the Auto Robot feature, but was not getting anywhere. I finally got an agent and thankfully it was Joshua De Jong. Joshua was very helpful in explaining all the options for my next trip. As I already have several more trips planned Joshua gave me information on your Wander Frequent plan. I signed up for it and thanks to Joshua, I am covered for a whole year of traveling.",5
Sevencorners,"My rep mr. Jong did his job well. Im so glad theres a company making massive profits off of mandatory insurance. Its like all the worlds mafias combined as one and are screwing everyone in the world now. Anywho, why tf would you ask customers to write a review without qualifying them. You dont know our biases and i dont know jack about this company.  There. Thats my review. Thanks for scamming me legally.",5
Sevencorners,I didn’t have to use the insurance but had to extend my coverage to another 2 weeks and I was 100% satisfied with the service I received from this company.,5
Sevencorners,Josh was a delight to deal with!  He was quite helpful in explaining the varying plans and help us choose the best one for us.,5
Sevencorners,Priced well no hasslesI didn't need to use the insurance thankfully. But I did call them before I purchased and got all my questions answered.,5
Sevencorners,"Absolutely terrible! I filed a claim back at the beginning of December with all the images needed, even bought the ""Cancel for any reason"", since we didn't know what was happening with the pandemic. I bought the John Hancock Agency Silver Plan.I called roughly 30days after to see the status and they apologized and said that they were actually running on a 52day turn around, so I gave them a little leeway. But then, I get an email in MARCH about needing additional images, so I sent them in AGAIN. I called to see how long it would take, they said an additional 30days from when I sent in those additional images. (I even highlighted the bank statements to dummy proof it). I was told it should be resolved by April 13th, it's now April 29th. I only just got off the phone once more and they said they will make a note to ""expidite"" my claim, so an ADDITIONAL 7 working days. This is ridiculous!!! This is such a fraud of a company. I just got back from a trip and I had unfortunately purchased insurance through them for it. That was before I was going through this claim process. I'm so thankful that I didn't have to make a claim. I will NEVER do business with them again. Go elsewhere! I'm having this much trouble on a claim that is less then $600 and I purchased ""cancel for any reason"". I'd hate to see how they dismiss people that bought the insurance and had a tragedy occur.",1
Sevencorners,I would like to commend Chat Agent Cameron for excellently fixing our country of destination issue! Job well done! Thank you!,5
Sevencorners,First experience with 7C but will use for next trip--very pleasant and knowledgeable customer service rep who answered phone in Indy,5
Sevencorners,Excellent service and support after two vacation plan changes.  Speedy friendly help!!!,5
Sevencorners,"Thankfully, we did not ""use"" our Seven Corners travel emergency insurance, but I was very impressed with the excellent customer service when I called to purchase the insurance, and delighted with the affordable pricing!  I have already recommended to family and friends for their future travels, and will definitely use again myself!",5
Sevencorners,"Very easy to use the online service and if problems or questions, the telephone staff are very helpful.  Have not had to use the travel insurance so far but am hopeful it will be great.",5
Sevencorners,Extremely helpful answering all my questions.  She was very knowledgeable.,5
Sevencorners,In the middle of all this Covid turmoil these folks have been so accommodating in moving things around to keep our ever changing plans covered. Thanks for the great service.,5
Sevencorners,Tried to get in touch with customer service whilst sick and couldn't. After leaving message they did not call back either Therefore useless.,1

Sevencorners,"Absolute scam of a company. If folks are writing a review simply because they purchased insurance, that doesn't mean anything. What counts is whether the company lived up to their promise, if they made claim processing easy, and reimbursements painless. Well, I had to contact Seven Corners on 2 occasions (one was a medical emergency evacuation, the other was a 24 hour flight delay). They failed miserably on both fronts. Calling from a foreign country, it takes over an hour to get an agent on the phone (same for whatsapp). Then, they conveniently denied all claims, even though my policy specifically states that medical emergency evacuations, as well as trip interruption costs are covered. They simply asked me to go to the airline, and said they would cover only $100 per day, even though the policy states $500 per day. What recourse do I have? None. Just stay away from this fraudulent company. It's infuriating how companies like this can be in business, very quick to take your money, and then they simply want you to disappear.PS: The company replied that mountaineering was not covered under my policy. It clearly was, even though I wasn't mountaineering! High altitude trekking was labeled as a Hazardous activity, and I specifically purchased coverage for it. Also, Travel Delay was covered up to $500, but they replied that it was $100. What a joke of a company. Good luck getting in touch with them should you really need them. They basically want you to disappear once they have your money. Might as well burn the cash. What a horrible experience.",1
Sevencorners,"We were so happy with the service that Seven Corners provided.  We had last minute questions about our travel to another country and their team was very professional and so, so helpful in not only answering the questions quickly but giving us insight into things that we did not realize we needed to know.  Also they have their pulse on traveling to countries and expectations about Covid coverage that was needed!Thanks again.",5
Sevencorners,"Fortunately, we did not need to file a claim on our policy. This review is to thank Seven Corners for accommodating our having to change our trip plans three times after the initial purchase. Very easy to deal with.",5
Sevencorners,"With all the travel requirements to enter BVI, being able to speak to a Seven Corner s Representative who knew exactly what we needed, was so helpful. We had a wonderful trip, it was calming to know we had the insurance to cover us.",5
Sevencorners,"I never had to use any of it,strictly for the One Health Pass for Philippines",3
Sevencorners,We had to change our travel dates several times due to COVID.  Seven Corners was very cooperative.,5
Sevencorners,The coverage dates for my wife and her mother's trip to Las Vegas did not align with the return trip. I called their Customer Service and it was quickly adjusted to my satisfaction.  I was on Hold for under 10 minutes; but the satisfactory resolution made it ok.,5
Sevencorners,"Very efficient, helpful and knowledgeable",5
Sevencorners,Seven Corners were a wonderful insurance plan for when we go to our Florida home.The online registration was easy and worked perfect for someone not very good with computers. Will use the service every time I travel,5
Sevencorners,Trustworthy company. Would definitely work with them again.,5
Sevencorners,"I had purchased travel insurance, but had it charged to the wrong account. So with the help of a kind employee of yours, the charge was dropped, and I was able to rebook the same insurance (length of time and amount) and have it charged to the account I preferred.

In dealing with Kendra Anderson I found the best customer service in a long while.  She was interested in my needs and mixed in conversation about myself and my place of residence.  I certainly can recommend her company based on my experience.",5
Sevencorners,I interacted with at least three agents and was pleasantly surprised at how prompt and knowledgeable they were. I was therefore quite comfortable and confident in making the purchase.,5
Sevencorners,Person I spoke to was very polite and helpful.,5
Sevencorners,This policy was easy to obtain.  The directions were easy to follow and it gave me peace of mind to have the policy just in case I were to test positive while on my trip to Israel.  Not having to incur the cost of a hotel and meals in case of COVID gave me the opportunity to relax and enjoy the trip.,5
Sevencorners,Seven Corners was incredibly flexible in helping me preserve the value of my travel insurance benefit. I needed to postpone this international travel twice because of the COVID pandemic. But their agent readily understood the challenge and Seven Corners responded quickly and clearly. They carried my policy forward to cover my recent travels .This was true customer concern and service!,5

With Jona’s help, we put her cares to rest, and now she is comfortable making our trip to Puerto Vallarta - to celebrate our 50th Wedding Anniversary!!!With Jona answering  all of our concerns, and providing detailed backup, we purchased international medical insurance that we are confident will respond should something unforeseen occur.Additionally, Jona was prompt, courteous and seemed genuinely concerned to help us take care of our insurance needs.She is to be commended. Because of our experience with her, SevenCorners will not only be our international insurance market of choice, but we will recommend it to our friends who travel abroad.My certificate # is 10RTC21-AOS-133487.",5
Sevencorners,"Bought travel insurance with John Hancock filed a trip cancellation January 29 2022 and they still haven't reviewed it ,They sent the claim to seven corners who is horrible i was told it takes 76 days to review , that is outrageous for a trip cancellation i can imagine if i had a medical problem or needed help with lodging i know were going through covid and more people are submitting claims but i haven't even been contacted all communications have been initiated by me and im still waiting every message is canned and say the exact same thing it will take 76 days to review well its past 76 days and i still haven't been contacted",1
Sevencorners,We had no concerns on our trip but it was a comfort knowing we had Seven Corners coverage.,5
Sevencorners,"Utterly useless company. My travel insurance coverage was about to expire, and Seven Corners kept sending me reminder emails to renew. It just so happened that I needed to extend my trip, so I clicked on the link they provided to renew my plan, and got a message saying to contact an agent. When I did so, they said that they couldn't renew my coverage because they were no longer licensed to do business in New York. I was like ""umm... ok... but I live in Colorado. So what's the problem?"". They said ""oh, we're not licensed to do business in Colorado either."" How did you manage to lose your license in at least two different states within a 3 month period?! And even after they said they couldn't insure me anymore, they kept sending me the annoying emails nagging me to renew my coverage! Would it really be so hard to coordinate the reminder emails with the state of residence of the customer?",1
Sevencorners,"The quote and purchase process was easy and straightforward. The app also made it easy to access our documents while traveling without needing to open zippers and pull out paper copies. Fortunately, we didn't need to file any claims, so we can't comment on the claims process.",5
Sevencorners,I. Am reluctant to even award you 2 star. I’ve used your company a few times now and received good service until now when I am trying to make a claim through having to cancel our holiday due to my Ill health. I am out and In hospital receiving treatment and you keep asking for more and more information that I have already given you.Goid when your taking out a policy not good if you try to claim,1

Sevencorners,"I purchased Round Trip Elite coverage for a river cruise in Europe because it specifically covered Covid travel complications.     The day before our return trip, I tested positive resulting in delay and additional expenses.    It took me 7 hours to get a hold of Seven Corners.   I phoned several times trying various options, I emailed all email addresses I could find.    Finally an agent called back and said she could provide a claim from as well as a few medical referals for Budapest.   She also advised for  a claim to possibly be reviewed, it was required to have positive PCR test even though US regulations accept antigen test.   Also required was a Physician's Statement.   She also did not know if the claim would be for Trip Delay or Trip Interruption.   I felt there was very little help/assistance.    They fact I couldn't get a hold of them for 6 hours makes me extremely disappointed.     I just called Customer Service to ask about claim filing on 4/13/2022 and answering service advised to expect a call back in 1 to 2 days!!  I am not feeling comfortable with this company and their products and suggest to look at others for travel insurance.    I might change my review after my claim experience but I would avoid this company based on the current poor experience.",1

Sevencorners,"Traveling is a real challenge now.  It is frustrating receiving directions from countries during covid.  Time constraints and mandatory travel insurance now needed for trips, is annoying.   Seven Corners allowed us to get the basics and a certificate to get us to thru the AP gates.   Honestly, the barest necessity.   We were talked thru the process and appreciate the simplicity.Travel requires lots of $$ to pay for the incidentals, testing, etc.   The easier you make it for us to acquire, the better.",4

Sevencorners,"I've been using Seven Corners since 2013. Although, I haven't had to fill a claim prior to this year (unaware of the awful service).COVID coverage did not included quarantine (which is what most people have to do if they are positive and asymptomatic). In order to be able to claim this ""benefit"" you need to quarantine under medical supervision and receiving treatment when nowadays is mostly asymptomatic with supportive therapy. I filed a claim on January 12 (more than 70 days ago) and I haven't received any news. Every time I called or ask, ""still in process"". The automated chat - no agents available. Don't know the status of my claim. I WILL NEVER EVER USE THEM AGAIN- also, my husband has a travel agency and we are no longer recommending Seven Corners. We found a much better insurance with great customer service and rapid response.",1
Sevencorners,I was in need for insurance for a single trip only. I contacted Seven Corners and was helped promptly by Sven. Only drawback was that he insured me from 15 to 19 March at a cost of $55.  I thought that I heard $35.00 for 18 - 19 March. So I suppose that it was a misunderstanding.,4
Sevencorners,"Seven Corners took over three months to settle a small claim. They were hard to get a hold of, didn't always return emails or calls. I would never use them again.",1
Sevencorners,"The person I spoke to about insurance was extremely helpful and honest about what would be the best coverage.We had to call during our trip and the agent was extremely helpful.We never used it, but the peace of mind having this insurance was well worth it.",4
Sevencorners,"very easy and afordable. It was required to have COVID coverage to enter the state of Israel, this was the best option out there. I'm only reviewing on the purchase process as I never actually had to use the coverage while there so can't speak to how that end would be rated.",5
Sevencorners,"There are lots of choices for travel insurance. I choose Seven Corners initially due to their helpful website. I decided to buy their insurance because of the great talk I had with Tristan. He was helpful and friendly and explained the insurance choices to me well. He pointed me to the package that was best for our travel needs. Thank you, Tristan.",5
Sevencorners,What I appreciate the most about Seven Corners is the updates and communications I received during the period of my coverage.,5
Sevencorners,"I specifically asked for trip interruption and trip cancellation for any reason, because I have kidney and heart disease. I chose your company over AAA, because AARP recommended you. When I got sick in Switzerland, and needed to change my flight, I was told I didn’t purchase that kind of protection. I will not recommend it to anyone, nor will I purchase it again. Not only was my trip interrupted, but on the day I was supposed to fly home, my flight was changed. Not once but twice. Very, very disappointed in this company.",1
Sevencorners,The peace of mind with COVID was worth every penny.,5
Sevencorners,"Certificate 1RTB21-AOS-100240I never had to actually file a claim so I don't have any idea about how responsive Seven Corners is during an actual emergency; but I was made VERY wary with my interactions with them prior to my trip. They seemed chronically short-staffed. Every time I called, I was put on hold and usually forced to leave a message or was transferred to an answering service; and once was called back the following day. I feel very deceived by the ""24/7 availability"" promise and will probably choose a different provider for my next trip. Also, they don't have great attention to detail (which is very important). For example, my wife changed her name after we got married and I needed to update her name on the policy. They did so, but they forgot to update the confirmation letter; so I had to call back, wait on hold again, leave a message, get called hours later, and have them press the right button.",3
Sevencorners,Seven Corners was fast in finding me affordable coverage and I was completely happy with their excellent services.,5
Sevencorners,No review text found,5
Sevencorners,"the website for ordering insurance was very well designed and thought out.  inevitably, i had to back track, to adjust some dates i had entered earlier, and this site kept most of what i had entered, once i returned back to the later stages of processing.  very good !i have no information on how competitive their insurance rates are, because i didn't shop around.  (too time consuming, after already finding one good website)i refrained from giving 5 stars, because i did not get sick, and therefore could not test any aspects of having to get re-imbursed by the insurance, thank god !  if this would work as smoothly as the website interaction, it would definitely be 5 stars.  but this is for somebody else to comment on.",4
Sevencorners,"We want to get Covid testing done at our option - without consulting a doctor, for obvious reasons. Your  did not agree, and your insurance policy did not have a simple courtesy too... We think that we wasted a good thousand dollars - and you wasted a good opportunity to be supportive and get our loyalty.",1
Sevencorners,I've been waiting a long time for a refund on my insurance refund used last year.  I had no return.,1
Sevencorners,"Heather, my agent,  is always very nice and helpful with any questions I might have.",5
Sevencorners,Efficient. Quick. Reliable. Honest.,5
Sevencorners,This is the second trip I've used Seven Corners and have been pleased with their customer service and the coverage. Their COVID coverage is good and provides and extra layer of assurance as we travel with international mission teams.,5
Sevencorners,"I have bought their travel insurance several times. Overall they offer good service for reasonable price. If there is any area that I could point out for improvement is the communication when it comes to the reimbursement: It took a some time to get back the money I have paid for medical services, but I got it. Nevertheless I didn't receive any communication informing that my request had been accepted, that any payment was sent back to my, etc. I just received some money quantity similar to what I had paid (it had some variation, I suppose due to the volatility of the currency).",4
Sevencorners,Fantastic company - very easy to deal with!,5
Sevencorners,"So far, we are extremely satisfied with our travels insurance provided by Seven Corners. Today your company helped us to update one of our policies regarding our replaced cruise itinerary. You will continue to be our favorite insurance provider. Thanks a lot.",5
Sevencorners,The rep I spoke to on the phone made the whole process very easy and understandable! I’d highly recommend this plan.,5
Sevencorners,The agent was extraordinarily helpful and timely.,5
Sevencorners,"Unfortunately, it was the worst and slowest service I had the opportunity to see. The delay in processing the Claims is memorable, and the email answer is always evasive and does not help to solve any problem.I do not recommend this service.",1
Sevencorners,"Thanks for not returning my money when it was completely out of my hands that I couldn't make my trip, wouldn't be recommending this company. Poor customer service",1
Sevencorners,Seven Corners offers excellent travel insurance. Agent April took excellent care and gave us sound guidance. We felt safe and secure with Seven Corners.,5
Sevencorners,"I made a really dumb mistake when filling out the required form to purchase our cruise policy. I called and spoke with Amy. Amy was not only extremely helpful, she was very positive, courteous, and friendly. It was a pleasure to speak with Amy. The customer service provided by Amy reflects positively on herself and Seven Corners Insurance.",5
Sevencorners,"On January 3-,2021 I purchased a travel policy for my husband Philip Williamson and myself for two cruises and air departing Feb 17 and returning March 13,2022. Policy # 9RTC19-28221.  I had to cancel our trip on Nov 19 due to being admitted to the hospital on Nov 2,2021 and still receiving treatment.I filed a claim (# 01917609) on Nov 19th. I mailed all documents via USPS which Seven Corners signed for Dec 24th. I called the end of January to see where in the process I was, but not able to get thru so I went on line and noticed nothing was there. I called and spoke with Candace and was told there was no claim in there system so she gave me a new claim number (#14711076).  Shortly after she called me and said they had found the original claim and she would expedite the claim. A few weeks later I went on line again and found that they needed more information from Royal Cruise Line.  Which I had explained to  an agent that RCL would not give me anything in writing but gave me cancelation numbers.  On Feb 2nd I submitted what information I had from RCL and advised Seven Corners per Jenny at RCL customer service that Seven Corners needed to contact them for the information at 800-327-6700.  I waited a few more weeks and contacted Seven Corners again and was told nobody had done anything with my claim. They would sent it to the claims adjuster again. Again I waited for weeks, I went on line and it showed I needed to send medical information and RCL info to them which I had done twice before.    I called and said it had been sent twice.  On March 18th I called and reach Kyle and he proceeded to go over everything and he knew I was very upset at this point. He contacted two managers David and Johnathan and I was told they would get this processed and I would receive a call back no later than yesterday March 21.  Again no return call, not really surprised!  Today I called and spoke with Kelly G (who went above and beyond her job).  I explained what was happening and she verified notes in the record. She tried to reach a manager but was unable to.  She decided to call Royal Caribbean directly even though that is not her job but she understood my frustration and what good customer service is.  She spoke with them and they told her they couldn't give her anything but then agreed to email claim department and me with the cancelation information. It would take up to a month for them to send it.  I was totally surprised when Kelly told me that Seven Corners never contacted RCL for 16 days after I gave them the information and was told they would handle it immediately.I was a travel agent for 35 yrs and would never be able to recommend your company again.  But prior to the recent service I used your company along with recommending you to our traveling companies for another policy.  I feel I must contact AARP which is who recommended your company.  I prefer not to contact my attorney or Facebook to advise customers.  When someone is sick and recovering they don't need to be trying to deal with these issues which good customer service should be handle.RegardsDebra MacJennett-WilliamsonHello, On March 22 I wrote a review of Seven Corners which wasn't positive. I am updating  my experience since then.  I am giving them a 5 star rating.  My claim has been completed in 2 days with situations they usually don't deal with.  I am so pleased with the customer service.  All employees no matter where they work should go thru customer service training if not doing so at this time. Teach what respect is.I want to acknowledge the following for working so hard, great customer service and follow thru.  So my thanks to Kelly G, Laura, David and Albert.I can highly recommend Seven Corners for travel insurance.Debra Williamson",5
Sevencorners,Easy to set up and it provided a wonderful sense of security!,5
Sevencorners,I didn't need to use my insurance policy but I had numerous date changes and the company was right on top of those changes.  The personnel was courteous and took care of my needs.  :),5
Sevencorners,Claim that I will not get answers for an extended period of time.,1
Sevencorners,"I filed a claim several weeks ago and have yet to hear anything back. I’m not expecting money to be returned quickly, but some communication on if the claim was even received would be great.",1
Sevencorners,Great Customer Service when we purchased the policy.,5
Sevencorners,"My purchasing experience was very easy, professional, and had a personal touch. I called and spoke to a rep that was able to answer all of my questions. Thankfully, I did not have a situation to use the coverage. I am unable to comment about the claims process.",5
Sevencorners,"Great service, easy to discuss and choose the right policy.  Good COVID medical coverage.  Competitive pricing.  I recommend them.",5
Sevencorners,"Frankly, I don't even remember what I bought, but I do remember having no trouble using the website, and getting whatever it was without delay.",5

Sevencorners,We had a great experience with Seven Corners Travel Insurance.  We unfortunately had to make a last minute change to our trip due to passport expiration issues and we were forced to move our trip out a few months.  We contacted Seven Corners and they were kind enough to allow us to move the coverage we purchased for our initial trip to our next trip without any hesitation.  The customer service is great and price/coverage of the policy is extremely competitive. When dealing with travel insurance carriers customer service is key.  Seven Corners provides a great customer experience.,5

Sevencorners,"I've used your insurance 4-5 times and I've never had to use it, I'm a 54 year old man who's in great shape never had covid and an avid surfer, the first time I bought the insurance it was $87 then it went to $120 and the last time was $187 I feel it a bit to expensive!",4
Sevencorners,"Certificate # 1RTB21-AOS-120620Very slow, poor services. It takes days to get a response from the assistance or claim services. Their assistance service is not adapt with the african continent. For example, I got injured in Tanzania, had no money to pay for medical bills because I lost all my credit cards, and the hospital I went to doesn't accept guarantee of payment from US insurers. The answer I got from the assistance service is: ""I apologize I cannot be of further assistance"". Leaving me stranded, although I explained to them what was my situation. I had to pawn my passport to get money to pay the hospital. And now all documentation requested by the claim advisor Mr Albert Turk, to process the claim has been sent to him, but till today I haven't heard from him again and all my emails sent to him remained unanswered. As I'm writing this, I'm still blocked in Tanzania with no funds, my passport is with the lender,no way to fly back home, I'm even struggling with accommodation, but all my pleas to my insurer goes to the deaf ears. Very sad, bad experience! Can't recommend SevenCorners products to anyone traveling to Africa!",1
Sevencorners,"Terrible company. I used them for YEARS, thinking I'm protected, and the one time I needed them when I got COVID and saw that they'd cover my COVID-related expenses (test + hotel), I filed a small claim. I was given the run-around for 7 months. My case was dismissed, I appealed and spent months on emails and calls with them, and only then they decided to cover only around $200 out of $500. It's basically a SCAM. I feel bad for all of the people I referred them to back when I thought they were legitimate. I'm not going back to them ever.",1
Sevencorners,"Didn't need to use the insurance but am glad I had it, just in case.",5
Sevencorners,"The initial purchase and product gets 5 stars.The renewal/ extension gets only 2 stars. I called prior to the end of the contract to extend the insurance. Due to an IT issue the extension was not possible.  After more than 48 hours and multiple phone calls to customer care department, the insurance contract was extended. Unfortunately, this delay created a gap in coverage and caused significant anxiety.  There needs to be a better process to overcome IT issues.",3
Sevencorners,"The worst experience I've had with an insurance company in my life. Dishonesty bordering on fraud. I took insurance to cover my trip to the United States because my mother was dying. I am resident in France, and don't have US insurance, so I took their coverage they offered for such a situation. When I had to visit the emergency room, I called for pre-authoristaion, which I was given. Now, a year later, I have received a bill from the hospital for $5000, and been told that my insurer declined payment. Additionally, a follow up doctor's visit was denied. And they took my premium payment. Would not recommend them under any circumsances.",1
Sevencorners,It was very easy to sign up to get my coverage which luckily I never had to USA. I will definitely use your service next time I travel tonUS.,5
Sevencorners,Very enjoyable informative and fun. Very nice accommodations food was excellent and everything was very clean. Robbie Was a vary good guide with knowledge of the area . Our vehicle was comfortable safe and dependable. All in all a very nice trip !,5
Sevencorners,"I needed to extend the coverage dates of my policy. I tried to do it online but could not see where I can do it so I tried the chat. I chatted with a bot first and then a live person got in. It was fast, friendly and easy. Thank you to the chat agent named Cameron for the help! I will get Seven Corners again on our future travels.",5
Sevencorners,Reliable shipper on time and the ring was as stated in the description,4
Sevencorners,I entered incorrect travel dates when I purchase the travel insurance.  Ami on the other end of the phone of Seven Corners took care of it in the blink of any eye.  I was able to view the corrected dates while I still was on the phone with her.Ami gave me the comfort that Seven Corners are available 24 hours around the clock to provide assistants and needs.  That's a comfort feeling and money well spent.,5
Sevencorners,"The representative is wonderful, pleasant, knowledgeable. I would love to have an employee like that.Unfortunately- due to your current numbers of issue and constraint, it took me 3 weeks to reach her, by calling, messaging, talking to answering service people, and emailing.Thank you. I did get the help that I needed.",4
Sevencorners,"Smooth, everything I needed done in a timely manor👍",5
Sevencorners,"I spoke to a live agent, asked all my questions and had a health coverage package for a months travel to Mexico done in one phone call.  Perfect",5
Sevencorners,Too expensive - I have an annual policy with Allianz but was told I had to purchase this one to travel to Costa Rica.  I found out later this was not sure.,1
Sevencorners,"Certificate #1RTCG21-AOS-100416It should not take this long to get this claim processed.Most of the other students in my class had the same trip cancelled by our university. I need that money back and this company is holding it taking advantage of their ""90 day determination time"". I am a college student and I am being taken advantage of. On top of it all, no one can tell me whether or not I am getting just 75% or the full amount back. As I didn't cancel the trip, I should be getting 100% but I wouldn't be surprised if this shady company only gives me 75% back at the very end of the 90 days. In addition, I get no updates, no correspondence or reassurance that someone is actually working on this other than responses that essentially say ""we are working on it"" with no further detail. I filed this claim a month ago and I want my money back in full now.",1
Sevencorners,Good service.  Reps that answer the phone are helpful and know the answers to my questions.  Nice to talk to a real person.,4
Sevencorners,We needed insurance to cover us on a recent trip outside the US. Our insurance broker recommended Seven Corners. It was easy and provided the required coverage. Spoke to a US based rep who tailored a policy then sent a web link to finish the process. Fortunately we didn’t need to use it.,5
Sevencorners,Couldn't contact customer service when I needed to! Left a message and never heard back from anyone!,3
Sevencorners,"My coverage was exactly what I need it to be and it was inexpensive, which is good because I was working with a budget. I was traveling to a country that would send me to a quarantine facility if I tested positive, so I really wanted to make sure the insurance covered this specifically. It covered this and more, and when I called the company to double check it was easy to talk to someone. I met with them without waiting very long and they answered all of my questions well. I am giving it four stars because I never had to use it (thank goodness!) so I can't speak to the reimbursements or anything- but it made me feel comfortable to travel.",4
Sevencorners,It is comforting to know we have international coverage when traveling.  We always use Seven Corners.,5
Sevencorners,Very comfortable. Easy to fill and lots of options.Fair prices,5
Sevencorners,Easy to work with and flexible in covering a trip not originally planned after one was cancelled due to Covid.,5
Sevencorners,excellent service nothing else needs to be said,5
Sevencorners,I needed a last minute policy. I ask for coverage the day I was leaving. I’m just a few minutes my insurance was in place.,5
Sevencorners,The only travel insurance company that I will ever use going forward! So many customizable and affordable options. Easy quote & purchase. And the best customer service!! They are legit when it comes to travel protection!!,5
Sevencorners,So far I've been trying to get in touch with an agent for over 5 hours.Have called several times.I still haven't been able to talk to anyone who can help me.My problem isn't even a complicated one.Had someone take my information so someone could call me back.Didn't happen.I'm on hold for another attempt now.Making the claims process purposely painful is scummy behavior.Edit: I've been informed it takes an average of 2 to 3 days to receive a return call. That would be unacceptable for any company. It is egregious for something like travel insurance.,1
Sevencorners,They were easy to contact and provided great customer service,5
Sevencorners,I think I found these guys through google. Bottom line simplest process ever I was able to do everything over the phone get exactly what I needed at a really reasonable rate. Some of these countries require crazy evidence of insurance to travel these days because of covid. The representative knew exactly what I needed and within seconds of me paying for my policy I had an email where I could print out the evidence and board a plane,5
Sevencorners,Excellent service.will recommend,5
Sevencorners,The agent was very thorough and helpful. He answered all my questions and got back to me in a timely manner.,5

Sevencorners,"I purchased Seven corners insurance policy while traveling in the US outside of my country, Canada. Due to a calendar entry error, my out of country travel insurance lapsed by a few days and the current insurance carrier Blue Cross insurance (Alberta Canada) would not extend, renew or assist! (Ive been with them over 33 years) the insurance coverage (No claims health all good) without traveling back into Canada. Seven Corners had me covered with equal to or better insurance coverage for the remainder of my trip for a reasonable price. I simply allowed a policy to lapse due to a calendar entry error. thank you seven corners I will be using you in the future.",5
Sevencorners,Just the coverage I was looking for at a very reasonable premium,5
Sevencorners,My previous travel insurance provider required speaking with four people before I could get a quote which was eleven times higher than the year before. At Seven Corners I spoke to a knowledgeable salesperson who found the right policy for me  in under ten minutes. The cost was a fraction of what my previous provider charged.,4
Sevencorners,"Easy to do business with, good customer service and follow up before and after the trip and reasonable price options. I would use this company again.",5
Sevencorners,"I have bought travel insurance from seven corners many times. I have. thankfully,  never needed to use their medical or other benefits but I have found their customer service to be excellent. Their advisors are well informed and helpful.

Sevencorners,Easy and comprehensive travel insurance to meet my trip's covid-related requirements!,5
Sevencorners,Nothing bad to say at all. I've never had to make a claim but the customer service has always been fabulous.,5
Sevencorners,I've been using Seven Corners since Covid Pandemic started for my travels. Speaking with the representatives on the phone was so easy and they were able to tell me which plans I needed for my travels!,5

Sevencorners,"Responsive and caring, excellent price.  (Glad I didn't need it, but it was piece of mind to have it.)",5
Sevencorners,I have had no communication on a claim so far....probably best not to send a review until a person has spoken to another human.,1
Sevencorners,Seven Corners was available on a sunday to allow the addition of a person to the policy!  We would not have been able to make our trip without it.  Thank you!!!,5
Sevencorners,"Easy to set up, great price",5
Sevencorners,"Mr Sean Newnum, the one who  help me, is very knowledgeable.And he explained the insurance every detail. He answers all my questions about the policy. I have peace of mind, knowing that I was covered in case if I needed. If I give a grade to Sean Newnum ,he is excellent.",5

Sevencorners,I got the best service,5
Sevencorners,Due to COVID I made the decision to insure a trip to Austria.  I explicitly talked about wanting insurance in the event the trip was canceled.The trip WAS canceled yet my insurance failed to cover my loss.  I feel like a victim of a smooth-talking saleswoman.,2
Sevencorners,"The required documentation and coverage provided for my recent was timely, professional and readily accepted by border agents overseas. Although I did not use any of the insurance while traveling it was reassuring to know that the coverage was available if needed and the price for coverage was reasonable.",5

Oddly, I noticed there was no beneficiary input when purchased so sure enough it was BLANK upon receiving it in my coverage summary. I called the 1-800-335-0611 number and was immediately connected to a very helpful person who manually entered my beneficiary information as well as sent me a new copy of the summary. EXCELLENT!",4
Sevencorners,Poor experience after a minor injury while traveling. Waste of money and time. Not recommending.,1
Sevencorners,"When I was looking for a provider, Seven Corners was very helpful and the wait time to speak to someone was minimal. Then, while traveling, I didn’t feel well and contacted them on WhatsApp. I chatted live with an employee who provided me with hospitals and doctors nearby and suggested places who had worked previously with Seven Corners. I did not end up seeking medical attention so cannot speak to the quality of doctors they partner with but their customer service was very helpful and the employees very kind.",5
Sevencorners,"We called to adjust the dates of our coverage because of a COVID change in the dates of our covered trip.

Sevencorners,Easy to deal with and reasonable premiums. Never had need to make a claim after carrying the policy for 2+ years.,5
Sevencorners,"I did not need to use the insurance, but as always the quote, purchase and confirmation process was easy. The thing that I did not like is that my flight was cancelled, so I needed to stay one more day in Germany. It was not possible to extend my coverage for that day. I think you should review this policy under force majeure situations. For a flight cancellation it does not make sense to request a 5-day policy extension.",4
Sevencorners,Tried a few other companies but very confident working with Riley. She was patient in detailing the best coverage. She was not pushy at all but super responsive. Very comfortable with my decision to use them because of Riley.,5
Sevencorners,This was such a waste of money and was forced upon us just to travel to Turks and Caicos. Great marketing plan you can’t get your boarding pass until you purchase this insurance from this company what a joke.,1
Sevencorners,The rep answered my question and verified the information. She then explained how I must follow up. Thank you,5

Sevencorners,"It’s a little hard to write a review for insistence that we thankfully did not end up needing to use but here goes! We were looking for travel insurance for medical and quarantine expenses while traveling out of the United States during Covid. Kendra was very helpful in guiding me in what we would need and helping me buy the insurance. Immediately after I purchased insurance, I received an email with all of the information we needed in case we had to file a claim along with insurance cards and information about the various ways to contact them if needed.",4
Sevencorners,Heather was so helpful when I called and knew exactly what I needed to go to Turks & Caicos. We will use Seven Corners again.,5

Sevencorners,My recent trip abroad was wonderful.  And then I discovered a positive covid test result hours before boarding my return flight.  Though symptoms were mild I had to stay in isolation.  My trip plans were interrupted.   Back home I quickly reached out to Seven Corners Inc.  JULIE at Seven Corners Inc. has provided just the right mix of information and emotional reassurance for me to follow up on my claim.  I feel thoroughly reassured!,5
Sevencorners,Ami was very helpful both time that I called.  I needed to know the cost of covering my airfare and the second call was to extend my coverage by one day.,5

Sevencorners,"I purchased 3 RoundTrip plans (1 Elite, 2 Choice) for my fiancé, sister-in-law and myself on an unexpected trip to Denmark for a funeral last week. We had a layover in Munich, Germany going to Copenhagen (CPH) and were supposed to have a layover in Zurich, Switzerland when returning back to Washington D.C. (IAD). But there was an illegal strike by the baggage and Terminal workers at CPH airport that left us delayed and without information for three and a half hours in the early hours Sunday morning. While we waited for information, we missed our connection to Zurich due to the delays. The original flight did take off to Zurich after three and a half hours of waiting but since we were connecting to the United States the carrier, Scandinavian airlines (SAS), transferred us to new direct flight from CPH to IAD. While all this occurred, we were at ease knowing we had Seven Corners travel insurance plans in our back pocket in case the carrier cancelled the flight and left us stranded. Would buy again — thank you for the peace of mind!",5

Sevencorners,"Unfortunately I bought this travel insurance a while ago, it was all a headache. I lost my money and put my health at risk. In the end, when I submitted a claim for the medical bills, they simply denied me the reimbursement.They are irresponsible, we should unite those affected to make a common claim before the court",1
Sevencorners,"Knock on wood, did not use the coverage. But, will never travel without medical coverage from Seven Corners. When my son was traveling and got severely ill in France, Seven Corners was AMAZING!! Will always be a booster for what they do and how they do it. From medical bills (our son was in the ICU for 14 days) to medical transport back to the United States, Seven Corners made the process painless, allowing us to concentrate on getting our son healthy.

Sevencorners,"Difficult to put my frustration into non-offensive words.  Weeks to receive any response from email.  Chats on line were completely unproductive.  Zero clear communication at sign up on how to apply for a claim.  The machinations required to get reimbursement are absurd.  And the months that went by before I got any reimbursement were unacceptable.  But when I needed to extend for one month, the response was instant.  You need a good operations analyst to review your claims communication and reimbursement procedures with your customers and overhaul the whole system.  Pathetic, unprofessional, and unacceptable.",1

Sevencorners,"The policy was fine, the customer service representative was friendly and knowledgeable.  I bought a bare bones policy strictly to cover the new Covid-19 insurance mandates and meet the requirement for my host country (Argentina).  My gripe is with the ""Declaration"" or ""Confirmation"" page that I was to present as proof of my purchase.  Instead of stating that the coverage was for Covid, quarentining, hospital, ER, etc., it was a tick list highlighting what I DIDN'T purchase - all of the extras I didn't opt for - cancellation insurace, flight reimbursement, hotel costs, etc. etc. etc.  There was a slight mention of ""Covid"" at the bottom of the initial paragraph, and nothing else.  It was underwhelming.  When I talked to the agent again, she mentioned that I could ""upgrade"" (appx. $100 more) to a similar policy that actually 'highlighed' the policy as Covid Insureace (in the page header, the narrative, etc.  She offered the upgrade as I seemed disappointed with the policy I had purchased.  I explained that I was quite happy with the policy - it suited all of my needs.  The problem was with how they presented it - the declaration buried the Covid coverage, the 'upgrade' would highlight Covid coverage for a vastly increased premium.  Clearly a marketing ploy.  = (",3
Sevencorners,"Super easy to use, great advice, thoughtful about budget and although we chose a more expensive plan we did not feel strong armed… more consultative than salesThank you",5
Sevencorners,"In my opinion, travel insurance is mandatory thign for those ones who are passionate about travelling actually. Of course, you might not believe in insurance but it's better to protect yourself from various unforeseen circumstances rather than thinking that you will avoid everything.It's impossible to avoid everything actually. I faced such situations when lack of insurance almost costed me life. Anyway, I have been using services from this company for more than a year and I have only positive emotions about the cooperation with it. It executes its duties fast and responsive.

Sevencorners,"Purchased insurance prior to COVID for our dream trip to Europe. When The pandemic erupted, our flights were canceled, but the insurance was useless. We lost a lot of money. Additionally, the money paid for the insurance was lost because they only allow you to extend it for one year. I’m sure seven corners made a lot of money due to the pandemic. Frustrating policy and when I called customer support, they were not compassionate.",3
Sevencorners,Very good insurance company at the same level of most European companies.,5
Sevencorners,Good trip insurance. I will definitely use it again on my next trips.,5
Sevencorners,Very bad. Don't waste your money,1
Sevencorners,"We paid in full and were sold a cancellation insurance policy for my son's trip through EF Explore who canceled the trips twice despite other people still traveling during this time. 2 years later my son no longer attends the school and EF only wants to offer a voucher for the full amount. They refunded all but $350 and told me directly that I would need to file a claim for all but the registration I paid them from Seven Corners and the policy amount for trip insurance for the $150. I filed a claim in early October. On October 20 I finally received a response they needed more information which was sent immediately. I did not get a response until I reached out on their Facebook post about their family game room with a ping pong table in mid January. They said Covid made things busy to promptly respond to claims (I think ping pong was the culprit) and they promptly denied they claim as fast as they took my money stating that the child no longer at the school qualified as a cancellation covered. They did  not respond for months and when a review was left they responded with a denied claim and money not refunded is for work that we never received the benefits from. What I was told by EF was not what was sold to me. Between the coordinated effort between the two companies, they make the process as difficult as possible so you will give up. Do not use this company and save your money on the insurance.I have had a terrible experience with both Seven Corners and EF Tours. I have received the standard response for you to provide information for review and have already done that. I have already done that a couple of times and I will NOT be doing it again. I was sold a policy that was useless. We didn't cancel the trip. I will not be using either EF Tours or Seven Corners ever again.Once again since you don't communicate well at all: i have already been lied to. I have already given you this information several times for ""review"". I have already decided I will not waste another minute of my time with your scam company. Enjoy your ping pong.",1
Sevencorners,"I did not experience any medical issues during the period of my insurance coverage so I did not have to use the insurance. Therefore, I do not have any experience to offer a meaningful review. I will set my review to average for this reason.",3

Sevencorners,"Seven corners reviewIf I could give 0 (zero) stars I would!  We purchased this for a 2021 trip to Belize.  I fell and shattered my wrist on the third day we were on the island of Ambergris Caye in Belize.  We contacted Seven Corners immediately.  They said I’d be covered for anything related to the incident for 180 days past the date of the initial incident.  And possibly longer (with authorization). So far all they covered was the airplane tickets home (which Delta would have done for us anyway!). When we called they kept telling us our coverage was terminated on May 10, 2021.  We KNEW that!  However, we’ve had substantial bills after arriving back in the USA.  My surgery was on May 7, 2021 (which was still before expiration of the initial plan coverage dates).  Seven Corners even denied charges that occurred on May 7.  We were given a contact representative concerning the claims.  Not only has nothing been paid, but after several messages, the assigned representative has not returned our calls!!!  The hospitals and doctors connected to the treatments have had no responses and/or received denials due to “terminated insurance”?!?!  No one will return our calls/messages!!  If we didn’t have other health insurance we would be BANKRUPT!  As it is, we’ve had to pay thousands of dollars worth of bills that Seven Corners should have paid OUT OF OUR POCKET!  The Seven Corners policy isn’t worth the “paper it’s written on” or the time we spent enrolling online!!We travel extensively and purchase travelers insurance allot!  WE WILL NOT PURCHASE SEVEN CORNERS TRAVEL INSURANCE AGAIN.  And we will give the same recommendation to the groups we travel with.",1

Sevencorners,"These guys are just awful. At the beginning of the pandemic I purchased cancel for any reason travel insurance. They refused to pay out on lodging for “Cancel For Any Reason” claim. The VRBO owner offered me a non-refundable credit, so in other words the only way I could be compensated was to reschedule a trip I no longer wanted to take. That is NOT Cancel For Any Reason”! The policy actually said “We will pay You for the following: (a) The amount of forfeited, non-refundable, and unused Payments or Deposits”. The VRBOs offer of a non-refundable credit is none of those things. Seven Corners cheated me by “interpreting “ the policy language to include things that clearly aren’t there. Again, how are you compensated for a cancelled trip if you have to reschedule the trip to not lose out?",1

I thought the $700 was on the pricey side but went with Seven Corners because of their reputation. We canceled our trip when the US state department changed their recommendation to not travel to Italy (due to increased COVID risk), but because of the small print in the policy, the expenses we had were not reimbursable, even though the policy was marketed to cover COVID-related cancellations.

On the last call the service operator assured me that i could expect a return call within the next 24-48 hours confirming that the policy was cancelled.  The call never came and the charge appears on my Amex statement.  Never again!!",2
Sevencorners,"The extensive coverage that was a required entry process for our destination was provided to us with extra care. Seven Corners was easily accessible, professional and reliable. Excellent customer service and on going communication with us, made us feel that we were being taken care of.

Sevencorners,"UPDATE:Almost 7 months after my initial claim submission they are ""still working on it.""PREVIOUS REVIEW:In the process of attempting to submit paperwork for a medical claim and it's turning out to be a massive headache.I thought Aetna was bad. This is turning out to be worse.",1
Sevencorners,This insurance do not work… they told you to pay the hospital and when you make the claim they ask you to send a lot of documents and at the end the claim get denied.Do not put in risk your health and your money.,1
Sevencorners,Quick and simple process. Perfect experience.,5
Sevencorners,Your premium is extremely expensive compared to other travel insurances,3
Sevencorners,Purchasing Travel Insurance was never easier. The Seven Corners web portal and description of the policy were clear and concise. I felt safer ordering travel insurance directly from a trusted source vs. the cheapies from a third party.,5
Sevencorners,"Seven Corners is a great insurance provider that is responsive and easy to deal with.  I had to cancel a trip for health reasons.  While I did not need to collect any claims, Seven Corners graciously extended the payments made on that policy to a future policy purchase within 12 months.  Their prices are consistently lower than competitors and their service is superior.  While I have been fortunate in my travels and not required claims, I am sure they will be just as customer oriented as they are on the front end.",5

Sevencorners,I dealt with Tristan who was very helpful. He listened to my trip and concerns and understood I didn’t want to overinsure since I had decent private medical coverage outside of US. He quickly contacted me when I left a vm. Thank you Seven Corners for aiding me on my approx 7 round of coverage over the years. Nancy,5

Sevencorners,"Do NOT use this company. My brother vacationed to Alaska and died of a heart attack unexpectedly on June 30, 2021. He has been dead for almost 6 months and they have yet to pay out anything. The funeral home in Alaska is threatening to take me to court because the funeral bill was supposed to be paid within 90 days. We have answered every correspondence from them and made too many telephone calls too count. They are horrible and I am in the process of filing a complaint against them.",1
Sevencorners,"Seven Corners was recommended by my company's health insurance broker and they made it very easy to get insurance coverage for me and my family before our international trip.

Sevencorners,"Countless others on Trustpilot, Google, Reddit, and a variety of other review sites have echoed the same sentiments that this insurance company is one MASSIVE SCAM. This insurance company will promise guarantees of payment to healthcare providers and later deliberately stall the process and simply not pay. You can call Seven Corners relentlessly and will be met with parroted rhetoric and outright lies about receiving a call back along with generic excuses about why claims have not been paid. This also includes out of pocket expenses.I was involved in a serious incident earlier this year which has resulted in over $165,000 worth of claims. Seven Corners has not paid one red cent to any providers despite giving pre-authorizations.  Even worse, I still continue to require aftercare and have consistently paid my monthly premium to literally now be denied of coverages by their modus operandi of using the excuse of requiring documentation that they already possess. The only option now is to file a lawsuit against them for bad faith, breach of contract, emotional distress and punitive damages.This company has been a nightmare to deal with and are downright robbing money from policy holders for coverages and payments that are deliberately not honored in regard to their contractual obligation to it's policy holders.",1
Sevencorners,"I was paying for a trip for me and my mom to travel to South Africa on February 16, 2023. Due to the complications that COVID caused me economically, I was unable to financially continue making the payments. I had paid extra for AnyReason Travel . About two months ago I had to apply for unemployment and began looking at others ways to decrease my debts. So once my inability to financially pay on the trip occurred I contacted EF GoAhead Tours to cancel the trip. I was told that I needed to contact the travel insurance company, Seven Corners, who in turn asked me to go back to EF Tours. For a minute I was being played like a ping pong ball because neither wanted to take full responsibility and return my funds. Eventually, GoAhead Tours refunded me a portion of the funds and stated that I would need to obtain the approximately $450 pp of which would be non-refundable but I would receive back approximately $449 pp from travel insurance.I have been continually getting the runaround and was told that I had to show proof of why I was unable to pay and since I was self-employed they asked for proof of my financial deficit. First I heard that they are still waiting for documents from me then they check the computer to see how often I've called to get this rectified and then say that they will call me back. Today was the last straw with the same promises and no refund to be just told once again that I would get a call within a few days.UPDATE: 12.3.21 received a letter that my request was denied due to ""Your policy lists specific reasons when benefits apply for the cancellation of a trip. Unfortunately, the policy does not provide benefits for trip cancellation due to financial hardship or reduced income in a self employed business. Please reference “SECTION IV TRAVEL ARRANGEMENT PROTECTION” In your policy for a complete list of covered reasons for cancellation."" Which does not state that financial hardship or reduced income as one of the reasons for denial per Section IV. Here is what this section states:SECTION IV.

Sevencorners,"We used 7 Corners for the first time for a trip to Europe. We paid approximately $800 for a policy that included medical transport and insurance for 3 people. This was approximately two weeks prior to the COVID pandemic. When we went to cancel, we were denied a refund; only allowed to apply our policy to a future trip. We were able to take another trip this past November that only included 2 people. We also traveled to the Bahamas for 4 days vs a 7 day European vacation. I feel that we should have been refunded our initial payment since we cancelled during a global pandemic and prior to our vacation. I was able to use my policy for my subsequent trip but I don't think that I will use Seven Corners again.",2
Sevencorners,"Re: Certificate #9RTC19-14999UPDATE:  I commend Seven Corners for the quick response to my review.  The company replied within hours of posting to say they would review my situation.  This morning they extended the life of my policy until the end of 2023.  I appreciate them reaching out and resolving my concerns so quickly.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I am disappointed Seven Corners puts a time limit on the life of the policy while the pandemic is ongoing.  International travel is spotty at best.  We purchased coverage for travel to Israel before the pandemic started and that country is currently closed to all visitors.  I understand a company cannot keep a policy open forever, but it seems appropriate for Seven Corners to refund the policy purchase price if they decide not to provide the coverage for a trip yet to be taken.",4
Sevencorners,"Customer service is superb.With all the covid related changes and cancellations, you made it easy to communicate and stay up to date.THANK YOU!!!",5
Sevencorners,"Fortunately, had no need to use the policy yet, but purchasing experience is great. All options are clear and easy to understand.",5

Sevencorners,Everyone we spoke to were helpful and friendly. Very informative.,5
Sevencorners,"Peace of mind during a time when travel plans - can get complicated.With shifting and unclear travel restrictions, something as little as a poorly timed (false) positive test can derail a trip connection or a hotel stay. Knowing that someone has your back in these awkward times is both financially and emotionally ensuring. Allowing you to focus on enjoying the experience of the trip.",4
Sevencorners,"Awful communication experience in getting claims processed, emails are rarely responded to; all of this in the past year, prior to that I trusted them. The level of continued anxiety and hours and being demoralised versus serviced in order to reveal errors they made or missing claims has had our entire International team go elsewhere. Sad about having to leave a company we all once valued for many years. i wonder if an overhaul is needed in training and claims service management departments as frontline service staff are lovely but unable to do anything productive relying on internal teams that never respond. Conflicting interpretations or ignorance from claims processors that were not policy clearly have reflected not enough training and too much ""power"" where it does not belong. The stress and hours trying to get claims rectified myself and team members have incurred does not add to good health or time well spent. add on @care i have emailed you 3 times and never have received a response.",1

Sevencorners,"I go on many trips a year, and if this company treated me well- I probably would have insured more frequently. But this will be the first & last time I purchase insurance from them. They are now ""ghosting me""/ taking their sweet time to process my claim - must be them just waiting for me to give up asking since it's been a month.I should've paid closer attention to the reviews, all the positive ones are from people who did not end up submitting a claim, but when you dig deep, you find people with the exact same experience as me - extremely long processing times, unresponsive representatives ""Oh you have a claim, our team is working on it diligently.""It's funny because they sent me a marketing email today saying ""Think Twice about how you buy travel insurance"" - you're right about that.",1
Sevencorners,Exactly what we needed for our trip.  Great experience multiple times!,5

Sevencorners,"I’ve used Seven Corners to insure several trips and it was easy to get a policy quote and get the policy purchased. What wasn’t so easy was to get insurance when my trip was extended after the trip already started.Since I was overseas when I needed to extend the dates, I used the chat feature and gave up after waiting an hour when my request was transferred to a sales agent. The second time I tried, I was able to get additional insurance, but it was a lot more time than should have been necessary.",4

Sevencorners,"The main thing in every trip is to know that you're in safety. I don't take out long insurance contracts, I prefer to take out certain travel insurance contracts for certain trips. Moreover, I would note that I always change companies which help me to take out an insurance contract.

I was amazed by the service of this company, because the staff seemed to me very polite and responsive, because they explained me everything in details.",4

Sevencorners,Seven Corners is excellent and easy to choose your best plan.  I have recommended to my friends and family. It is my travel insurance company of choice.,5
Sevencorners,"The resort is beautiful, the actual room and location was five stars, however the service was 3 stars. We were there a total of 4 days and the way we were treated was quite disappointing. We were definitely being treated differently because we weren't blonde, blue eyed, geriatric, celebrating our retirement or turning 75 years old. That's not to say there wasn't one or two that seemed genuine and happy we were there. I called the front desk once or twice and both times felt as though I was bothering them. I'm only guessing that if you don't fit the I'm rich and old description they will give you mediocre service. Definitely felt that they treated us like we weren't worth the hassle or we weren't going to tip. Our tips sucked because service sucked maybe next time they don't judge a book by its cover, if anything we tip just as much or more than most people. Additional pros: breakfast was great, the omelette chef was kind, the pool was nice.",3
Sevencorners,Great service I really like,5
Sevencorners,It was easy to get everything set with seven corners! Never faced any trouble.,5
Sevencorners,"For my original policy I purchased online by the recommendation of our group scuba dive leader to Maldives. That was easy enough but wish I knew more about your options of plans including the Wander Frequent Traveler. Since I have another international trip this month, I wanted to learn more so I called Customer Service. Unfortunately they could not help me after a long wait and then having them call me back. They tried to transfer me to Sales but that did not work so I called the Ph# she gave me. Again a long wait to get a call back but finally was reached by Kendra who was immensely helpful and patient to explain the benefits of the program and eventually signed me up for the year!! I am glad that we worked thru the differences of Liaison Travel Plus so I could make my decision to be covered for all my trips for the next year as I do travel internationally quite often.

I knew I didn't need it, but during the COVID I liked to have some security since Japanese medical cost is very high for non-Japanese.The process of getting this insurance was easy and to extend it was not so bad, except they kept ""reminding"" me to extend it even after I extended it.I recommend this insurance for any traveler going to Japan for more than a month.",4

I have been purchasing Travel Insurance from Seven Corners  for several overseas trips over the years. I always received excellent service  and in some cases I had an Insurance claim which was always settled to my satisfaction.  Most recently I dealt with Ms. Laura O. - Bilingual Sr. Customer Service Advocate, this lady is top notch, she always responded to my eMails  quickly and kept me informed of my status. I had to cancel my 2020 Trip because of the China- Virus, the company was very professional in keeping my deposit on file for the next trip I am taking. We are taking a one month trip beginning in the middle of November in 2021, my previous deposit was applied and I turned out  that Laura O. contacted me that I will receive a refund. This is very commendable, what an honorable Company, I salute them for being so loyal & honest  to their customers.  Laura O. handled the refund and it was promptly credited to my Visa Card...

Sevencorners,"The coverage is great, but the company must have a glitch in their system. I was very deliberate with dates I requested for coverage, but just before the flight, I discovered my coverage started the day after I purchased the coverage, not the date I requested it to begin. Luckily, the ending date did cover my trip. My son and daughter-in-law purchased coverage on the same day and their dates for coverage were incorrect as well, beginning and ending before the trip. Obviously, we should have reviewed the confirmation, but we were very careful entering the dates so didn't think there would be an issue. My son didn't have time to get it corrected through the company before the trip, so he had to buy another policy.",3
Sevencorners,Excellent service and very hospitable service.thanks again.I will be calling again soon for more insurance.,5
Sevencorners,It was easy to purchase and happily i had no need of It.  Thanks,5
Sevencorners,"I had a routine mammogram, a very small cancerous tumor was found and they refused to pay a dime of the bills for the mastectomy and radiation because my cancer, they said, was a pre-existing condition. If I could give 0 stars, I would.I had no way of knowing that a small undetectable tumor was growing in my breast. When is was detected at less than a millimeter, it was a ""new"" illness for me. There was no way of knowing that a few cancerous cells had started growing before the policy start date. By the same logic, a heart attack caused by undetected heart disease would count as a pre-exisiting condition and would not be covered, right? This company will find a way to weasel out of paying.",1
Sevencorners,"Did not need to use the policy, but felt secure knowing it was there if needed.",5
Sevencorners,Excellent travel insurance and customer service l.,5
Sevencorners,Three stars is average from me.  I never had to use the service but I did get it before the country lifted the band on heath insurance.  I did travel without an incident but it is nice to know you have it if you need it.  They wouldn’t allow me to renew through the website I had to start the whole process over even thought there was no claims made against the policy.,3
Sevencorners,The agent I dealt with made the experience of deciding what insurance best fit my needs easy to understand. The cost was very reasonable and gave me peace of mind while I traveled.,5
Sevencorners,We’re glad that we had the coverage even though we didn’t have to use it!,5
Sevencorners,"Quick, comprehensive, and approved by the Turks & Caicos government. No issues",5
Sevencorners,You've responded to me expeditiously at every turn.  Now I'm just hoping for a positive outcome.  It's a terrible thing that happened to me.  But I'm grateful that I was forced to get insurance in order to travel to Turks and Caicos.  Obviously they knew the possibility of something like this happening to tourist.,5
Sevencorners,The price of the insurance was pretty reasonable with an adequate coverage. Looks good overall.,4
Sevencorners,It is nice to have this company available if I were to ever need it.  They are professional and give me great peace of mind.,5
Sevencorners,Seven corners was easy to talk with on the phone. They answered numerous questions before we took off on our three week trip. I felt secure that we had back up in case anything were to go wrong. Luckily we didn’t need to use the insurance but definitely nice to know it was an option.,5
Sevencorners,I had good conversation with the insurance representative and she clearly stated the benefits of the travel package that I purchased.  I am glad I didn't have to use it but had peace of mind that I would be covered.,5
Sevencorners,"I was very happy both with the product, as well as the excellent customer support. Would definitely recommend.",5
Sevencorners,"Great customer service, answered all questions, and when need to cancel the refund process was extremely easy.",5
Sevencorners,Easy and quick response to queries. Would definitely recommend!,5

Sevencorners,The agent I spoke with when looking for insurance for our international travel was very knowledgeable and helpful. She knew exactly what we needed for our trip given the destination and provided us quickly with a quote that was reasonably priced. Seven Corners provided all the paperwork we needed to show proof of insurance. It was an easy and affordable process that met our needs.,5
Sevencorners,Easy and not overly priced.  Very helpful and efficient client service team,5
Sevencorners,Exactly what was needed at extremely reasonable price!,5
Sevencorners,Have not received an answer about new date change for our trip . Sent email 2 days ago. Very disappointed.,2
Sevencorners,Heather Kleinschmidt was really easy to work with.  Getting insurance for our trip was painless!,5
Sevencorners,Terrible. They said they are a legit health insurance but that’s not true. They are refusing to pai my allergy bills and saying thay I have a pre existing condition even afte i sent documents of previous doctors(back from 2018 on) and a letter of a specialist(saying that due the tests the did its impossible that what I have can be pre existing) please dont get this health insurance. I have a lawyer working on my case because they are just the worst.,1

Sevencorners,We were not able to take our trip due to the pandemic.  The service providers on our trip refunded all of our money.  Seven Corners let us use our insurance on a new trip instead of losing the money we paid them.  They did not have to do that so I will use them on my next trip.  Excellent company.,5
Sevencorners,"Absolutely beautiful time spent at Seven Stars Resort and Spa for our anniversary and belated birthday celebration. Great selections for those who want vegetarian options and healthy smoothies with beautifully prepared fruits and all breakfast options which is included during your stay.   The Restaurants on site- The Deck- I’m addicted to their Ancient Grain salad and continue to make it at home now- their conch dish was yummy, pizza a good option and their Seven restaurant for dinner, we found to be our favorite while on the island- even after we tried Infiniti, LaBouchon and Coco Bistro- not bad places at all- but Seven was our favorite. Staff for housekeeping, front desk, concierge, bellmen, dining staff, groundskeepers, covid staff and pool staff are all commendable and if I could name them all I would. I wish there were photos that I could give stars next to.  During Covid it felt stressful completing everything to safely visit Turks and Caicos but please don’t let it deter you from traveling- it was so worth it as we had excellent service in every capacity on the resort and off. Enjoy their most spectacular beach and sunsets for us.",5
Sevencorners,"I was very happy to have your coverage after reviewing your ratings. You are listed as one of the top ten in an article of Forbes that make me pay for your coverage.We extended our trip for a week and I got two e-mails from you with notice of coverage end and an invitation to extend the coverage if needed.I tried twice to extend the coverage and it was impossible. I had no option but continue for a week on my own.Your link does not refer to a page to an extension of coverage but to contract a new one. I do not know if your system, reading a US IP address refused to proceed the extra week of coverage desired.That is the reason of my 2 starts rating. On the other side, happily of not having any issue during the trip, so no basis to rate another aspects of Seven Corners.",2
Sevencorners,Great customer service. Very impressed.,5
Sevencorners,They have good customer service.,4
Sevencorners,My daughter is a US citizen but has lived and worked in New Zealand for the last 3 years.  I bought her a Seven Corners insurance plan just for peace of mind while she is away.  We never had to use it but I always felt good knowing it was there if we needed it when she is so far away from me.  Thank you!,5
Sevencorners,"I don't feel like I can leave 5 stars because I have not made a claim to have the full experience.Other than that, everything has been great. They are very quick to communicate through web chat or phone. The price seems competitive with market rates for the coverage. I felt safe using them, mostly because they have responded within minutes 100% of the time. I have contacted them about 6 times to provide coverage and to get extensions.",4
Sevencorners,"Despite the tension and confusion which Covid caused between our arranging our trip for 2020, and finally being able to take it in 2021, Heather of Seven Corners couldn't have been more helpful, reassuring, and nice.  We headed into our adventure feeling comfortable insured for come what may. She explained everything, was creative in finding solutions, and totally sold me on Seven Corners. (I had found you in a review in Forbes). Besides already haven't given your name onward, I look forward to using Seven Corners for our next trips. Thank you.",5
Sevencorners,"Seven Corners helped me immediately with getting Covid coverage while traveling to Turks and Caicos Island. They were fast, responsive and helpful . I highly recommend them.",5
Sevencorners,"My husband and I signed up for Seven Corners' Explore North America plan on a recent 2 week vacation to California from Asia as we were concerned about medical expenses if we should contract Covid-19 during our trip. The process of purchasing the insurance was extremely smooth. The relevant clauses were summarised in an easy-to-understand table and we received our insurance quotations instantly. We could also access their detailed policy document for added diligence. Once we purchased the policy, we were immediately given medical cards which included emergency contact numbers and also that of Seven Corners' Helpline. We didn't end up making any claims (fortunately) so I can't provide feedback on their claim procedure. However the entire process in terms of fact finding to the actual purchase of their policies was extremely smooth. I would definitely recommend them.",5
Sevencorners,The process was easy and the rep was very thorough and patient in answering my questions.,5
Sevencorners,"Beware this company! I booked a scuba trip to Little Cayman in May 2020 and got the best and most expensive Seven Corners Travel Insurance Policy (cancel without a stated cause). The trip was cancelled because Cayman was closed for Covid and and rescheduled for October 2020. Cayman was still closed then so the trip was rescheduled to Turks and Caicos in October 2019 just a week before I need to get knee surgery. I am not allowed to leave the country for 2 weeks prior to my surgery so I had to cancel. I put in a claim to Seven Corners and they denied the claim because I waited ""too long"" to make it. The bottom line is I paid for travel insurance, health circumstances prevented me from going on the rescheduled trip and they are refusing to pay. I am appealing that decision and will update this review to favorable if they decide to reimburse me. Until then I say beware of these people who are trying to hold on to my money when I had a legitimate claim. Beware!!!",1

Sevencorners,We obtained travel insurance just in case we contracted Covid 19 in our international travels. We didn't get Covid 19 but felt much safer traveling with the extra coverage.,5
Sevencorners,"Reasonably priced, easy to obtain, exactly what the country traveling too required",5
Sevencorners,I had purchased a duplicate policy on accident and they refunded my purchase promptly.,5
Sevencorners,The customer service rep was helpful and informative.I had purchased the wrong insurance and the customer service rep made sure I purchased the correct insurance.Thank you,5
Sevencorners,"My husband called about my and my children’s luggage being lost. We never received a call back or an email. Had to pay out of pocket for cloths and medicine. I never plan to use this company on any of my traveling, again.Amy Henderson.",1

So after all ,my trip done and back to USA , coverage expired and my money didn't return to me.",3
Sevencorners,Didn’t need to use it but purchasing the insurance was easy and price was competitive.,5
Sevencorners,"I was very happy with Seven Corners.  Travel Insurance is always one of those things you hate to spend the money on but you're glad you have it if you need it.  Fortunately I didn't need to use the travel insurance on this past trip, but I felt that the service I received when signing up and the information about what was really necessary for the trip was good.  I just wanted basically to be covered for medical and a few of the travel expenses.  I was able to do that without spending a fortune.",5
Sevencorners,"I've yet to have any need.. gratefully, but the security of knowing I will be taken care of if necessary; gives me great peace..Thank you kindly Seven Corners...!!!",5

Sevencorners,"I attempted to do my due diligence in reviewing the coverage available through the Inbound Basic plan before selecting it. A lot of information about what WAS included in the coverage was presented up front, with less accessible/transparent information relating to the Exclusions. However, the breadth of things that WERE included was wide (e.g., things like chemotherapy and mental illness), so I went ahead and selected it. Then Seven Corners contacted me regularly during my coverage period to warn me that my coverage was expiring soon and to encourage me to renew and extend. It wasn’t until the day of expiration that I realized that any claim relating to covid was in the “exclusions” and would have gone uncovered. How disappointing. As a young, healthy, double-vaccinated adult, the chances of severe health complications during my travels are very low; I simply wanted to have a responsible safeguard in place. Thus, my overall experience with Seven Corners leaves me disappointed and distrustful; messages asking me to renew/extend from the very start of my plan made me feel unprotected from the very start, and discovering that the most prevalent cause for health concern at this time (the pandemic) was actually uncovered the whole time confirms it. I paid for a false sense of security.",1

Sevencorners,"I was asked by Seven Corners to provide a review regarding travel insurance I purchased from the company. Fortunately, it was not necessary for me to file a claim on this policy. How can I be expected to provide a review under such circumstances? How does anyone provide a review on an insurance product (life, medical or homeowners, as well) if there is no claim? Seven Corners did cash my premium check successfully.",1
Sevencorners,"Awful. Simply won’t pay any medical bills, claiming everything is a preexisting condition. Won't let you cancel plan after claims are submitted, even after all the claims are already denied. So bad that now newspapers are investigating their business practices.",1
Sevencorners,This is a good insurance very easy to buy but when making a claim for reimbursement it is all a nightmare. They ask for documentation that is impossible to provide and seek a way to deny payment for any nonsense. They are not honest. There are more insurance options that are responsible. Seven Corners is the worst experience.,1
Sevencorners,Thanks. It was easy to setup,5
Sevencorners,"Easy to deal with, competitive rates.",5
Sevencorners,"I'm currently experiencing difficulty due to trip interruption. I've called in, I've utilized the chat feature, etc. I've asked for my policy to be extended beyond my original travel date and was told this was possible, but then received notification the policy was ended anyway. I was told I could file a claim, but I won't have the supporting documentation to do so until my travels come to an end and I return home. I'm frustrated and disappointed.",2

Sevencorners,We had a wonderful experience with April. She was johnny on the spot and answered all questions quickly. We are very happy with the service and would do it again.,5

Sevencorners,"Seven Corners was easy to sign up for as a major medical precaution for a close to three month stay away from the USA in Japan. COVID-19 insurance was covered separately by the air carrier, JAL.I had no emergencies thank goodness so happily did not use the insurance; however, it provided some sense of security as I mature to an age where health problems are to be expected to occur. Touch wood, I am still in perfect health as I continue to move beyond three score and ten.Seven Corners kept in touch with options to extend the length of coverage… and when I didn’t they made a contribution to a charity on my behalf.",5
Sevencorners,"Scam company, stay away! Fake positive reviews or the individuals never needed to file a claimI legit had a flight delayed then canceled for airline mechanical problems. Also, my luggage was lost and this scam company wrote me back saying their coverage ""should not be construed as a confirmation that coverage applies."" Total scam. They use every trick in the book to deny your claim.Also, their reply is phony and theatrical.",1
Sevencorners,"I have travelled internationally over the years but never purchased travel insurance until the Covid pandemic came along. My main concern was to obtain insurance against the possibility of contracting Covid in a foreign country. The customer Service Reps at Seven Corners were very friendly, patient and efficient. They helped me decide on the best insurance policy to suit my needs. The policy covered hospitalization, treatment, quarantine and other medical expenses and mentions Covid explicitly in the policy documents. The policy documents contained language acceptable to the foreign country that I was planning to visit. Proof of insurance was available electronically the moment Seven Corners received payment. The purchase price for the policy was reasonable (a total of about $400 to cover myself and my wife for a period of one week). The trip thankfully was uneventful but I plan to stay with Seven Corners to meet my insurance needs in the future.",5
Sevencorners,"The customer service was outstanding. After talking to a few other trip insurance companies, I was totally frustrated with all the red-tape and indifference. My first call to Seven Corners was awesome, and you have my business for as long as I'm able to travel",5
Sevencorners,Economically priced trip insurance for peace of mind.,5
Sevencorners,Made it extremely easily and affordable.,5
Sevencorners,We had booked a trip pre-Covid and had to postpone it a couple of times.  Customer service every time I called to postpone our coverage was exceptional. We had made some changes and were refunded some of our premium.  We finally took our trip and the coverage has now ended.  We will definitely use Seven Corners again for our next trip.,5
Sevencorners,super straightforward and informative answers to my questions. heard my concerns and needs and helped me make a plan for insurance coverage to serve my particular situation.,5
Sevencorners,"My agent has been wonderful to work with and absolutely helpful. Mary Kay is amazing.However there are some elements of the website that are BEYOND frustrating.First, please update the website on how we can enter groups of more than 10 uploading a spreadsheet or entering them individually - I had to redo entering the information multiple times which was really challenging.Lastly, please make an option to opt out of birthday emails....we have hundreds of people we purchase travel insurance for our program and our inbox just gets flooded with the emails. We would really appreciate the ability to opt out of these emails please! Thank you so much!",5

We don't usually get travel insurance, but with the pandemic raging throughout the world, we opted for insurance.  Our customer service representative, Kendra Anderson, was so pleasant and helpful, answering all my questions and text messages. If anyone needs travel insurance, I highly recommend using Seven Corners.By the way, we found Seven Corners because we knew someone who needed to use its benefits.  They were stranded in another country because of Covid restrictions and were supported every step of the way by Seven Corners. Their referral gave us the opportunity to travel without worry.Thank you, Kendra and Seven Corners!",5
Sevencorners,Easy & fast. Very affordable & complete coverage options.,5
Sevencorners,I was heading out of the country and was looking for COVID insurance in case  I was not allowed back in the US. I had purchased insurance from the airline when I booked my flight but it did not cover COVID related issues.I called to speak to a Seven Corners representative and much to my surprise she was very helpful and got me just what I needed. If you have any questions don’t be afraid to call. Callback time was reasonable and the representative was very professional. After using this service and learning what coverage they have offer I will no longer be going thru the airline for insurance.,5
Sevencorners,Seven Corners provides great service and is easy to work with.  I highly recommend them for travel insurance which has gotten to be even more essential lately due to covid.  I actually had to file a claim with them several years ago and was completely satisfied with they way it was handled.,5
Sevencorners,reasonable pricing and good customer service.,5
Sevencorners,"I've used SC for numerous mission trips in the past and been well satisfied. However, this was a personal trip and being over 70, coverage is limited. I had some questions. Could not ""connect"" with anyone other than the answering service who first recommend I search online at the website, which I had already done without success. You had to declare your inquiry and ""emergency"" to get a phone call returned. Even then, I did not receive the return call until after I had departed USA for Europe--with my questions unanswered.",2
Sevencorners,Thanks for good experience using the service,4
Sevencorners,When I decided to take out insurance on my trip it was to be insured in case of any reason I could cancel the trip. It was not clear to me that it was optional. I thought it said optional cancel for any reason included. Before my trip I looked at my insurance again and realized I didn’t have that insurance snd it was too late to add it. Please make these terms more clear during the sign up.,2

After much research, I decided on Seven Corners and do not regret my choice.Unfortunately we had to abandon our vacation plans as a result of Covid but my claim was dealt with professionally and whilst it took about six weeks to receive the stipulated re imbursement, I was kept abreast by a status update and received a check in the post today. Very satisfied!",5
Sevencorners,do not file a claim! it will be denied. the worst travel insurance. do not waste your money,1
Sevencorners,I wrote them to cancel the policy immediately after I purchased it and never heard back so it was $189 that I spent when I did not need to. I was going to Inform my credit card to contest and request a refund but did not follow through.,1
Sevencorners,Great product and easy to use system for obtaining travel insurance!,5
Sevencorners,I paid but never used due to cancellation of my trip by the trip provider due to Covid. Thought I would be refunded since it was out of my hands!,1
Sevencorners,"I made an error when I purchased my travel insurance.

Sevencorners,"While visiting Turkey this spring my husband suffered a bug bite on his toe. It was very painful (kept him up all night). In the morning we decided not to take any chances and went to the emergency room. They  ran test to make sure he didn't have any poisons in his system. Treated the bite and sent us home. Bill $499.00 which we paid. They assured us the paperwork they gave us would be accepted by our travel insurance. When we got home I went to the website and followed the instructions they provided. We honestly weren't expecting to be reimbursed. Monday my husband got an email stating a check was in the mail,it came today. Also our flight home was postponed for 21 days due to covid, we did change Airlines , but decided to extend our trip two weeks. I called to extend our coverage, was told I would get an email as to the premium which was under $100.We are planning a 90 day trip in  2022 and will us them again.",5
Sevencorners,not useful. just waste if money.,1
Sevencorners,"Wonderful customer service. Laura and the team were excellent in communication and efficiency, and provided me options after my trip was cancelled. This gave me reassurance that I chose the right insurance company, and I look forward to choosing them again for future travels!",5
Sevencorners,"filled out a form online for travel insurance...I entered the cost of the trip twice and as a result my premium was more than I had been quoted...my fault. I contacted them by phone the next day- quick pick up, not on hold very long- and Candice was very helpful in voiding my policy and putting in the request for full refund on my premium...would use again!!!",5
Sevencorners,"Best customer service out of 50 telephone calls required to reschedule a trip.Due to an emergency, it was necessary to move the departure date for an international trip a week ahead of the day planned.  It involved dozens of calls to airlines, hotels, limousine services, bus transfers, mail hold, on and on. As a result I experienced many cases of customer service, but by far, by far, the finest example of customer service I encountered in the entire rescheduling was with Seven Corners. Their remarkably efficient and professional customer advocate, her name is Keyona King, if you want incredible assistance, quickly revised my policy to add the additional travel dates. During our conversation, I realized I would advance one year in age due to the earlier departure date, and she checked it quickly, and reassured me I was within the age range that would not change my premium. I paid for the additional premium over the phone with my credit card, thanked Ms. King, and hung up. Just to give you an idea of how personal their relationship is with the customer, I soon received in my email a birthday card wishing me a happy birthday during my journey! I never write reviews, because they’ve become a little overdone, but this particular customer service experience is so far above the average that I couldn’t help but share it with you all.",5
Sevencorners,"My husband and I had a trip to Japan booked for April 2020.  Unfortunately, Covid happened and we could not go.  We were able to get our airfare, hotel and all other charges refunded with the exception of the Jrail passes that we purchased online.  I made several attempts to contact them and left numerous voicemail messages which were never returned.  I even went to their office in Long Beach twice - which was closed.  When I finally got a response from them via email,  I was told that my tickets had expired and that I could no longer get a refund.  This would not have been the case, had they been responsive to all my earlier attempts to contact them.As I had previously purchased travel insurance with Seven Corners, I filed a claim for the $542 cost of the vouchers.  After waiting several weeks, answering several questions and providing multiple documents, I was informed by their claims advisor that my claim was denied because the underlying cause for the cancellation was Covid related.  I find that to be in very poor faith.  Covid was not even an issue when I purchased my policy.  What is the point of having travel insurance if they don’t provide any protection at all.  This really sucks!!!  Save your money and go with an insurance provider that is more trustworthy.",1
Sevencorners,Easy and courteous agents.  I’ve travelled abroad three times this year with my family and I appreciate the service.  I will never use another Travel/Medical Insurance company other than Seven Corners.,5
Sevencorners,Easy to use website and helpful customer service.  You don’t get answers right away but they give you a time line when they will respond by and then keep their word.  Refreshing.,5
Sevencorners,Ami stayed on the line with me to make sure  I get my updated insurance card.  Its my second time calling today.  She is quick and knowledgeable.,5
Sevencorners,"When I bought insurance for my trip back in April I was told by 2 or 3 different reps that I would be able to purchase a 2nd policy while I was still on my trip. I needed a total of 180 days covered and they only allow for 90 at a time. When I called to get a new policy I was told the company policy had changed, and there was nothing I could do. I am still on my trip and have no coverage. This is exactly what I was worried about and why I asked so many follow up questions when I originally signed up for the policy. I made sure to ask if I would need to return home between policies, if I would need to wait until the policy expired before buying a new one, etc. I was told multiple times that buying a second policy would be no problem at all once the first one expired. I would not have bought this policy if I had known that I couldn’t be covered for the whole trip, and now that I am already on the trip no other insurance company will start a new policy with me. It is not ok that a policy change on your end overrides promises that were made when I purchased my policy. This is not how you want to find out you no longer have any medical coverage right in the middle of a big trip. Just super disappointed and honestly scared.",1

drivetime,"I purchased a vehicle from you all 6 months ago. No issues! You guys took my $11,000 down payment and now the car I purchased is dead? I called they extended warranty, took my car to the Jeep dealership, called the financing company and they said my credit will be affected by this situation if there is no resolution because I will technically have to voluntary give the vehicle back. This is ridiculous and garbage! I have bought multiple vehicles through your company and never defaulted or had an issue! You guys need to fix this or you will be facing a law suit!",1
drivetime,"The customer service from Andre was amazing the car itself was a bit lackluster. The buying experience should be exciting. It was until I took an actual deeper look at the car. I describe it as I feel like I borrowed a family member’s car. A bit dirty,dusty, definitely looks used. The wipers were tested during inspection but due to the temperature of the day I assumed the fluid was just frozen. After checking and filling it later (it was empty) it appears there a bigger issue. I called to ask about having it looked at onsite since I purchased it yesterday and was instructed to call a car repair shop. So not I have to invest MORE time to fix it myself. Very upsetting.",3

She even helped me get my autopay set up so I don't have to worry about making my first payment, it's already set up!

I reached out to Drivetime in Tyler, Tx and met two of their representatives, Mr. Kyle Blackman and Mr. Deantae Taylor. Both gentlemen were professional, knowledgeable, and patient with me as I waffled back-and-forth between vehicles, then finally settling on the vehicle  they had suggested the very first day.It appears that our experience is unique to THIS Drivetime in Tyler and THESE young men. We were very pleased with the whole process as they helped greatly ease what was a bad and stressful situation for us.",5
drivetime,What made my experience with drive time great was the sales man he. Every question I had he answered. Then he let us test drive the car before running my credit in case we didn’t like the way it drove he told us about all the things they have available.,5
drivetime,Drivetime and their bank are the biggest crooks out there.  You get 1 month behind and No not several 1 month is all it takes they charge account off and repo car. They dont care if you’re at work or what they harass you constantly calling you and your job. They will not work with you at all. I had money coming out of account on a certain day it was only 2 weeks late they repoed carI have never dealt with a company like this before and never will. They are the ducking worst ever,1
drivetime,"Alan Meyers made the experience amazing. Courteous, professional and a true pleasure to deal with. Looking for a new car….go see Alan. You will not be disappointed.",5
drivetime,"The car purchased was advertised at a different price at the dealership.  I noticed and contacted sales woman and did not hear anything back. In addition, the car was dirty upon pickup.  The car was hosed down but has to be detailed after.In addition the car had less than half a tank of gas. I was advised that full tank is not provided. Overall they were quick to get me in and out but the cars appearance and pricing was less than desirable.",2
drivetime,Sat there for 4 hours & got rejected for not minor thing on my pay stubbs that they were press to point out & when I go out my way to show my proof of income they then want another form of statement like what??. Yal financial department is terrible & to have me sit waiting for a car that can make triple times over is irritating & goofy. Soon as good money come through yall play dumb & act like yall don't know what to do.,1

Luckily we had GAP insurance that paid the cars off. The staff at Easy Auto are very friendly and understanding.  I thought this time I wouldn't be able to get a car through them, but I was wrong.",5
easyautoonline,I have nothing bad to say about the experience other than some of the vehicles are over priced and the interest rates are way too high. People buy cars there because they can’t afford a big down payment and don’t have good enough credit for financing elsewhere but then end up having to pay triple what the vehicle is actually worth.,3
easyautoonline,Mary made it easy and was there to answer any question I had and they gave me a second chance after I completed bankruptcy,5

easyautoonline,"i have never had a better time while buying a car. Everyone was knowledgeable and helpful but weren't afraid to show their human side. Despite the many varied things going on at the same time, everyone stayed calm and an amazing amount of work was getting done.I especially want to recognize April. She made me feel like I could tell her anything without fearing it would have an adverse affect on my being approved. Despite a few glitches here and there I was able to drive away in the car that I wanted and I feel that without April that might not have happened. She really knows her stuff.",5
easyautoonline,"Liked the buying experience and Zack has been good at trying to take on the problems of a car, but these issues with the car  should have been things resolved and were most probably preventable with wiring issues of a car that Easy Auto has had for almost 6 months. Issues with corrosion on connectors that were issues for backup camera, fuel sensors, and oxygen sensors. Engine light constantly coming on. This car is a nice looking car, but right at this moment I won’t take any type of trip anytime soon until these issues are corrected.",3

And a payment plan that works with my family budget.,5
easyautoonline,"Everyone was curtious, knowledgeable,  and helpful.  Everything was explained fully and I was given an option for a full 5yr warranty,  at an additional charge.  My new(to me), runs well, no issues, so far and looks good.  A pleasure to drive. Completely suites my needs.",5

easyautoonline,The customer service was excellent. Zach Cross helped and explained everything so clear and understandable. He was also super polite and one of the best car salesman I ever met 10/10. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase,5
easyautoonline,The experience I got and was very pleased is being able to see what vehicles you had before even going and the salesperson contacted and had everything already in process and approved by the time I got there. Usually at buying a car you will be there at least couple of hours or half day and here I was there and all paperwork discussed vehicle test drove and paperwork signed and leaving with an hour to hour and half if that. I was very pleased with my experience and I love my vehicle,5

easyautoonline,"Let me start by saying Zack was great! It's what happened after paying the down-payment, signing the contract, putting insurance on the new car so I could leave the lot and driving the car for over a week that I get a call and get told that I have to bring the car back because of my work history!!! I'm being told that they can't get me financed... like why would you not do all of that before letting me take the car home for over a week???? I literally have no other vehicle to go anywhere and have children... it's not my fault you didn't check everything before I left the lot. I was also told that I could get my down-payment back but who is going to pay for the down-payment on the insurance that I was made to get before I left the lot??",1

easyautoonline,"Mary is absolutely amazing, she helped us  with ease! I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a new vehicle go and talk with Mary!",5
easyautoonline,"I have to share my experience buying from them.  I had looked at a couple vehicles on thier website because a jeep I saw online was apparently at this dealer. Too be honest I went in expecting the car lot slime experience.I had spoken the Mario a few days prior about the Jeep and the fact I have a credit score of ""0"". I have never had any credit and at 53 and find myself in a situation. I tried to go to the lot that day(Tuesday ) but I live 30 miles away and have a small construction business going into its 3rd year and was not able to get there. Mario told me he would wait for me after telling him I couldn't get there till Friday.    I arrived at 10am Friday. The jeep was spotless and waiting. I was approached and greeted extremely friendly. He remembered every detail of our conversation. I was not given a sales pitch or run around. I was given the keys and told to take it as long as I needed to be certain it was the vehicle for me. I took it for a decent length of ride and checked it thoroughly. I was like a brand new vehicle. Absolutely beautiful.                   When I came back I did look at another truck but decided the Jeep was the one I would like if I could even buy it. Since I had no credit score I brought my laptop and several employees helped me locate the necessary paperwork I had. Several were in involved working on my deal. I had my doubts because I had no credit. The entire time I was treated wonderful. They even said while we are working on getting you approved take the jeep for a ride. When I returned I was presented with a deal. Yes I over paid a little and higher interest but that's on me for not having a credit history.  This group was professional and respectful. It blew me away. Instead of no or come back when you have credit and a huge down payment they put in extra work going through my bank statements and got me the Jeep I wanted. The Jeep is a 4 door wrangler in show room condition.  An affordable down payment and warranty.  None of the  can you come up with more money games. They are absolutely great to deal with. Thank you for making it easy.",5
easyautoonline,"The whole process was quick and easy. From me finding my new car on the website, to getting pre-qualified, to them even coming to my home to complete the buying process. I have never bought a automobile with so little stress. I recommend Easy Auto to everyone I know. I will never go anywhere else to purchase a new vehicle for myself or my children. Thank you for being so amazing and taking all the stress and guess work out of the car buying experience.",5
easyautoonline,they were friendly and helpful. they were knowledgeable and answered any questions I had.,5

They go above and beyond to make you feel welcome to get you in a car. They are the best and I would tell all my friends and family to go to Easy auto in Dalton. But now my complaint is going online paying my car payment and getting charged an extra $3.99 or &4.99 that's ridiculous and I could careless why you gotta charge us ya should have kept the ladies in the Dalton Georgia Easy Auto so we could take them out payment then! If I mail you my payment and it does not get to you on time do not call me cause I'm not going to be nice ya should not be charging people extra just that simple,5

easyautoonline,Met with Chris and was able to make a fair deal quickly on the car. Quick and easy process.,5
easyautoonline,"Easy auto are good at what thy do ,they have nice car with good standard the company is okay,and I enjoy their products..",4
easyautoonline,"From the moment they answered the phone the customer service was amazing. Rafael (I hope I got his name right) was kind and LISTENED. He never once judged my situation but instead said let's see what we can do to help you. He took my information and called back and said you are pre-approved and can come up tomorrow and look at vehicles. It seemed too easy and too good to be true but the next day I went up to the dealership to see what they could do. I was greeted by Rick, I explained I had spoken with Rafeal yesterday and he said we were expecting you so take a look around and meet me back up at the front door and tell me if you see something you like. I did look and Rick was there at the front to let me drive a couple and ask any questions. It took some time after finding one for Rick to work with Pam and get everything squared away but they were both patient and kind and I drove away in my vehicle that has a 3-year warranty (I didn't feel cheated). I got home drove it and on the second week something wasn't right, so I called and explained what happened and Chris answered the phone (again so helpful and nice). He assured me I had a warranty and gave me a number to call to take it to have it looked at. I call the mechanic and he said Yes, I know those guys and they sell quality used cars but if something is wrong then they will make it right. I have to take it to be looked at Monday, but I don't feel overly worried about it because I think they actually care about me as a customer and that means so much to me. A little explanation on my situation - in the past two years my husband and I had a baby who has MSUD (a rare genetic disorder) then my husband has a heart attack and dies. My life was fairly normal and then all at once it became really hard. My current car was great and then the motor went! I was left with no husband, no car, and a special needs child to care for, and I needed someone just anyone to act like I mattered, and these people did just that. I am thankful that there are good people and a good business left in this town. I often feel like my time and money doesn't matter to anyone but me. This has become apparent since I now have little of both; however, it mattered to them.",5

The lord puts people in our paths for a reason. My credit was pretty much shot from 5 years ago when I got sick almost lost everything,except my house.Then 8/15/22 i lost my mother who didn't have a burial plan. These folks seen something in me so many lenders didn't. Pamela saved me from a diabetic episode and got me back to myself, along with personally handling my sale! Currently 3 open accounts with them. However they have bosses,and guidelines to follow, they're not the lender but have a good sayso in most cases. Clear open honest communication and you'll  leave with a smile as me and my wife did.Thanks you folks, I tell everyone about this place.My new motorcycle is what tops the cake,they went beyond customer service with that purchase.  🌟x10 looking forward to another bike purchase so maybe my wife could get her own! 😀 we'll see!!

easyautoonline,"UPDATE: We got the car on the Friday before Labor Day, we get the car we were not Satisfied with the car we had. We were informed that they had a 7 day policy for return and/or exchange. My boyfriend calls up there and the lady in the office states that our 7 days are up, that the first day starts the day you get the car. She states she doesn’t write the contract she don’t have the ability to change she will call her manager/sup and see what they say. Needless to say that is not what the paper work says it specifically says SEVEN DAYS STARTING THE DAY AFTER you purchase the car. She then calls back and say we can do exchange but they have to see if we are approved through the finance company. I request the sup/manager number to speak with them she tell me that they are not able to talk, they are doing a home delivery. So I’m over easy auto at this point. She tells me she will run it call me back. She does not call back, she sends a TEXT saying we were approved and we to expect us up there. I asked her, if there was a extra down payment, if so how much? She text and her response was NO. When I say UNPROFESSIONAL UNPROFESSIONAL! We get there and they say they want us to test drive the Ford Flex overnight before signing paper work which we did. We get off work, get ready to leave and the car don’t start. We call and they say they are sure it’s the battery, so they replaced the battery. While signing the paper work I ask her now in the contract it states we have to take the car to an easy auto approved mechanic is that true or not, she states no you can take it to any mechanic, but we already know what has been done to the car so if you take the car to the mechanic and that states something has been done to the car we can look in our records like we going to intentionally do something to car that we need to get back and forth with. SHE MADE THIS EXPERIENCE ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE FOR US. Everyone else in the office was of GREAT help GREAT. Andre was the most helpful and apologetic if it was not for him it would have been a refund. You can tell he new, but the others around him were also very helpful and very pleasant. We had some family asking where we got our car from and was going to send them some customers, I would not send my enemy to deal with that experience we are the customers, that assist with providing jobs. No CUSTOMER should be treated the way we’re treated by her at all. Andre gets FIVE stars but bc of this experience Easy Auto gets Three.Andre was of great assistance, he worked with us in getting us into a car, and was a great person to work with. Would definitely recommend them again.",1

For the next 2 days me and my two girls begin to get accustomed to the new car. All of a sudden I get a call saying we have to return the vehicle because I hadn’t worked at my job for 1 years, only 9 months. This wasn’t an issue at all when we signed the paperwork. If they would have said this before I put money into the vehicle and got accustomed to it, then it wouldn’t be an issue. They will not repay me for the money I’ve paid for insurance and they said the could take my deposit! Im sure 90 percent of these reviews are made by them as well! A bunch of crooked lib thieves trying to steal hard working peoples money from fees and down payments. Shame on these people.",1

easyautoonline,We bought a car from easy auto in dalton years ago and paid it off and decided to return because of our excellent experience there before!! First thing my paper work for our purchase was a big pain thought we had it all done the day of purchase but had to return that Monday for paperwork and we noticed the windshield had a ding in it and the key was so wore out you could barely get the doors to lock and the detail job was awful but they sent me all around dalton to get a new key and sent me to safelite about windshield!! And they took it back to detail again and yet the car still had nasty stuff in cup holders when they brought it out but I said I guess I’ll do it myself! Then safelite dalton scheduled appointment to replace windshield because ding in it was deep. But got through all that then took car to appt for windshield to be put in and after two hours sitting there with a toddler they were done told us not to wet windshield for two days we’ll we didn’t and 5 days later it rained and it was pouring on the inside of my 22000.00 car all over dash and all the electronics so I took it back to safelite dalton the next morning I told the man it was pouring and he got really smart said it would be another two days before he could fix it so we left stopped by easy auto just to see if they could possibly get someone from safelite to come to our home to repair it cause they paid for it to be installed the manager was there he came out and looked at it was friendly but wouldn’t help us so he sent a man named Mario outside and he was the rudest rudest man I’ve ever met!! Mind you we had already been there 3 times about the car we just needed them to help us but they couldn’t do that!! And mind you we live about 45 miles from dalton and gas is 4.09 a gallon!!!! But after all day I finally got in touch with a human customer service at safelite and they finally scheduled us appointment at home the next day!! I will never never do business with dalton easy auto again it was too late to return my car for a refund by two days or they could have had the car back !!! What happened to that location and all the friendly people that worked there that were always willing to help?,1

easyautoonline,"I took my daughter to get a car from Easy Auto and our experience was a NIGHTMARE. First off they sold and approved her for a which was the car we did paper work on. (at least that's what they told us) Now you know when you buy a car you have to have full coverage insurance put on it. So we got insurance put on the car we we're going home with. Only for them to call her the next day to tell her that she went home with the wrong car. Which means that the car we were approved for and the car we had just gotten full coverage insurance on was 2 different cars. So they call my daughter and explained this to her and told her that she needed to bring the car back, which is what she did and ended coming home with a car she had never seen or tested. She needed  a car really bad so she went with the flow and excused that mistake. She get this other car that they sale her. We get full coverage insurance on yet another car and get home and now the are saying that they are having trouble verifying her address. Accused us of lying about where she lived and ended up requesting that, that car be returned as well. I've had to get insurance on 2 different cars at this point that is my money lost. I feel for some reasons (I don't know or understand) these people didn't want to sale my daughter a car. I will never do business with them again. I will see that my friends and family never do business with them. I don't believe in doing business that way. I pray that no else has to go through this. It was HORRIBLE!!!!BUT In the end this was a blessing.",1

easyautoonline,We've only had his truck for a few weeks and something tore up on it. They wouldn't get a wrecker and have it towed for my husband to have it fixed. Ridiculous.

easyautoonline,"Beginning this review with the words ZERO HASSLE AND PRESSURE. I was in the market for an upgrade on my current vehicle, browsed by the dealership Taylor and the entire staff greeted me courteously and expeditiously. Mentioned my wife had just previously bought an SUV she was in love with from them,explained my needs and off we went for a test drive. Taylor and Kristin helped crunch some numbers gave me TOP dollar for my trade where as the other dealers wanted to give me a a couple thousands. I went around town to see who could beat their offer nobody couldn’t come close. Love my car by far the easiest car buying experience Me and my wife have ever ran across. I will absolutely be coming back and referring to friends and family!!! Side note I caught a flat Monday Kristin immediately took charge and took great care of me! Family treatment that is rare to find now a days and simply don’t get from “the other guys”. Give em a try!",5

easyautoonline,Good morning everyone my name is Jeriesha Jaynes. I have been paying for a car from easy auto almost a year now. I have been making my payments on time every 2 weeks on a Friday. My boyfriend name is first on the lease but I am also on the lease. And i also handle the payments every 2 weeks with my debit card. I am giving you all a huge warning in regards to the heavy set black guy who seats behind the desk. He is not a good business man. He doesn't check his computer records for payments that are clearly on my payment log. He will call and give people who do not have issues paying their note on time a hard time. Just be aware of who you decide to give your hard earn money too. And this is truly my experience. I told the young lady who kindly help me out today. I believe her name is Sam to let the manager know i urgently have to speak to him. Because this has to stop. I have never had so much trouble when i pay on time. Now this message does not mean everyone there is this way. I just believe the heavy set black guy is not good for their business establishment. I look forward to hearing from the manager.,1

easyautoonline,I was in the market for a second vehicle and I found one at EasyAuto in Knoxville that was perfect! I filled out everything online and was contacted right after. I worked with Pete Antonelli. He made it the quickest and easiest car buying experience I’ve ever had! I even referred one of my sisters who went the next weekend and bought a car herself through Pete! I highly recommend EasyAuto. They are much easier to work with than fancier and more expensive brand dealerships that simply aren’t worth the price! You aren’t paying extra on an overinflated priced badge on the grille here!,5
easyautoonline,"Set us up with a vehicle. Drove it home, had it for a week. I live with family but they had to have name of mortgage holder and their number.

easyautoonline,I had been approved at a few of the bigger dealerships but I loved the communication that I received from Carl and Jeff. We had been waiting for the title to come in for a car that I thought I was in love with but after weeks of waiting Carl worked with me and helped us find a car perfect for my family and I without going over budget. I AM ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH OUR 2013 FORD EDGE. It drives perfect and has everything I and my kids love!****Updated***I had went to East Auto under the impression that I was going to a buy here pay here. Then I was told that they use a finance company to finance vehicles. This is not a finance company this is a scam. They call threatening you the day after your payment is due. I work nights and they call during the day and I had texted them letting them know I can’t talk. I had made a partial payment in good faith keep in mind I’m not even 30 days behind and they texted me in was refunded they had already put it in repossession. They are rude and very unprofessional. I had qualified with other dealerships with regular financing but they had the vehicle I had been looking for with a great down payment and now I’m living in a nightmare and it’s only been two months!!! If you consider Easy Auto RUN far far awayThe people at the dealership was amazing but the “finance company is a sham” if you go to east auto use your own finance company. The dealership and people are great the finance company is a nightmare,1
easyautoonline,Great experience with Chattanooga  Easy Auto. The manager to salesperson April. Done a great job  I will buy from this dealer again,5

Mark Harden helped me get a car with an adorable down payment and bi-weekly payments. Had a great experience, the best experience I have ever had purchasing a vehicle. Thank you guys.",5
easyautoonline,I have been a customer of Easy Auto for atleast 4 years now. My experience in the past has been delightful. This time however I regret going back and trusting the company. Our usual dealer had moved to the Cleveland office and that should of been my first que to go there. I felt as though the relationship was less than par. Now I am dealing with mechanical issues with my new vehicle and getting the run around with the dealership. I regret fully trading in my old car.,3
easyautoonline,"We purchased a van and we test drive it found out the air didn’t work. Told them we would not want to make purchase unless it was fixed. They told us it would be and to drop it off Monday . Purchase was made on Friday. Later found out that they knew it wasn’t working so I really don’t understand why they would sell it instead of making sure everything was working first. Now two weeks later we are still with out a vehicle, out the money for the down payment and the car lot doesn’t seem to even care but why would they they they got the sale and the money for down payment. I’m so over the excuses because originally they said it was jUst clogged then they said it was electrical then the guy who does the electrical part traveled then his wife got in a wreck and then now they are saying it’s clogged again. This is the worst experience I have ever had. I thought this would have been a great place but I guess I was wrong..",1

I mentioned the fact that the website stated the car had cruise control but all he kept saying was yeah sometimes the website states something that isn't a fact. Also on the 3rd day the engine light came on and there were 3 small chips in the windshield and I am having to pay a 40 down payment to get my wind shield fixed because the windshield isn't covered under warranty, but they sold me the car knowing the windshield had chips in it",2

easyautoonline,"The sales experience was great and quick.  My only feedback would be that if you are someone that by circumstances you can't control and have to overpay for a vehicle and financing,  then you should have gotten 2 keys and 2 keyless entry fobs with your overpriced vehicle, new tires, and a full tank of gas. A vehicle that you pay $14k for and add financing of $8k on too, but is only Kelley blue book value of $8k. Please do better for others easy auto.",3

easyautoonline,Make sure you take the vehicle your looking to buy to a mechanic first and have them look at it or else you might be in the same boat as me. Only got to drive my car for 2 days and had to take it to the shop and it’s been in 2 different shops for 3 weeks. Made 3 payments on a car I haven’t even got to drive but 2 days,3

easyautoonline,I bought a Mustang Gt from Easy Auto in Dalton and couldn't have been happier with the process and the car. Great prices and the employees are friendly and helpful. Especially have to brag on the salesman Victor. You rock buddy. A big thank you to everyone at Easy Auto Dalton. 👍,5
easyautoonline,"I went to Easy Auto in dalton and left with a 2007 mustang GT. The next day after I purchased it. Believing it was a sound vehicle I was completely wrong. I was stuck in Acworth with no ride home. And I contacted insurance and tried contacting them but there was no answer. I couldn’t get them to pick it up with a roll back until at least 2 days later. I went back to get another car and this time I actually took it home with me for a night to test drive it. I took it to a mechanic to make sure it was a sound vehicle and it is. Easy auto did pay for the sound check on the vehicle. So I now own a 2015 Chevrolet Cruze. It smells like cigarettes and has a lot of cigarette damage in the interior and also Has a lot of hale damage from being in a storm. no discount from that either btw. But it gets me from my home to work so I don’t really care about all those things. interest here is insane. I wouldn’t get yourself into the position I’m in if I were the person reading this right now. The employees there are great at their job. But I still wouldn’t recommend them if it meant burning in hell. They sold me a piece of crap 2007 mustang for 12,000 dollars plus interest, (my fault for buying into their bull crap). When the retail value for a mustang that needs that much work done to it and of that year model is roughly worth 4-8,000 dollars. A lot of their cars are insanely over priced just like the mustang.",3
easyautoonline,Easy auto is great place to get a vehicle they took care of me quick and got me into my mustang I will recommend them to everyone,4
easyautoonline,Great salesman...crappy car. It has been in the shop 2 times already and I have only had it 3 weeks. The warranty is covering the repairs but the aggregation is epic.,2

easyautoonline,"I’ve bought two cars from Easy Auto and within a couple weeks both cars were in the shop. The first car’s issues took a while to resolve but Easy Auto was accommodating with getting those issues fixed. I really liked the vehicle but unfortunately my teenager totaled it after owning it for 9 months. My credit is less than stellar due to a back injury I acquired and being out of work, easy auto’s finance company was willing to give me another shot. Unfortunately, the second car purchased from them blew the transmission within 2 weeks of me having it. It just went to the shop today. The quality of their vehicles is obviously lacking.",1
easyautoonline,"Great sales team, cheap down payments, easy and quick to get into a vehicle. Now the bad. Interest is worst thing I've seen, very high prices for the vehicles and mine broke down on the way home. Cost me over $200 to fix not 3hrs after buying.",3

easyautoonline,"My former car just ""gave up the ghost"".  I really needed a different car as soon as I could.  I decided to go to Easy Auto in Cleveland, TN.  Why I decided to go to there is because I had gone there previously and they were helpful then (that was in 2013).  They had the car I was interested when I saw it online and the process of getting it was very easy and the salesman, Zach Cross was very helpful and friendly.  He helped me a great deal through the whole thing.  I have had the car for two weeks now, and it is just what I wanted.  I would send anyone there if they need a vehicle and have the whole process very stress-free.  Thanks Easy Auto!!!",5

They victor bettis told me I had the vehicle and they were delivering the car Monday at 12:00 pm and at 11:40 told me I couldn’t get the vehicle.  I put on the back burner because of other customers.  Already had insurance on the vehicle. How do I know they wasn’t driving it all weekend. Ver very disappointed.  I wouldn’t try to deal with victor or the dealership if they were the last buy here on earth. They wasted 4 days of my time!!!!! Don’t let them tell you there’s a financial company the finance company is the same entity they just covering the owners hind end from law suits. Check you buy here pay here rules I bet there breaking them. Like reselling repossessed cars. Georgia law states that they can’t do that they have to go to auction.,1

easyautoonline,"Excellent experience, my son had been looking to buy his first vehicle on his own ( no co-signer) he had been given the runaround at other places. Here at Easy auto he was treated 1st class by the salesman, Mark Hardin and GM Anthony Shipley.  Anyone looking for their next vehicle should look into Easy Auto.",5
easyautoonline,"Buying my new car recently at Easy Auto 123 Hendra was a real pleasure. The people  couldn’t have been more helpful. One potentially serious hitch was needing to call RACQ to open the fuel cover, the cable had come off. The car had not been put into my name with RACQ so I had to join then and there which cost $209 and a lot of worry at 9pm at night. Easy Auto really stepped up the next day and said they would refund the what RACQ wouldn’t even to 100%. Actually RACQ were, as usual, marvellous  and refunded the entire amount. Both companies extremely good to deal with.",5

He talked me through it and I was able to drive away with my beautiful car. Thanks, to the Dalton easy Auto team.",5
easyautoonline,"Aaron the salesman was perfect.Financing was easy.There was some issues with the vehicle, but Aaron assured me, he would take care of it.I asked Easy auto to get my license plates, and to get a handicap plate. They didn't. They also registered the vehicle in knox county. I live in Sevier county. So I spend up to two hours for changing the county and the plates.",3
easyautoonline,"I had the pleasure of J.W. Noeller being my sales representative at the Dalton, GA dealership and I want to say he went above and beyond to help me get a great car (2010 Mazda3). I live in Alabama and he had everything ready for me when I arrived. He patiently waited the 1and1/2 hours it took me to drive there. Everyone was extremely nice and very courteous.  Thank you J.W. and everyone at EasyAuto for giving someone with not so great credit a chance. Great job.Barbara Womack",5

easyautoonline,"I went to easy auto to try and buy a car . and i would have to say the experience has been horrible and unprofessional. I will not buy a car from this place they claim to run like a buy here pay here but that is far from the truth. a buy here pay here does not run your credit and yet this place has ran my credit not once but twice in just three days. they have givin me so me different numbers i would have a better understanding  of a toddlers written essay. this place is just out to make a buck. they told me on first approval that my payments where going to be 138a week for a term of 220 weeks this was on a 15,000 dollar car.",1

easyautoonline,I have to say Aaron and the rest of the staff worked really hard to help me get the truck I was looking for. It just so happen Aaron was off the day one came in and I received a text from Mark who overheard us the week before letting me know about it.

easyautoonline,pre qualifying was easy. Paid a little over the blue book value but was a good experience overall,4
easyautoonline,The Easy Auto team worked very hard to get me into my car of choice. They made sure my payments where very comfortable for me. But I feel like they drop the ball when it came to the actual sale. I had to figure everything out about the car myself. I wasn't shown or told anything about the car. There were issues with the car that the dealer didn't know about or decided not to point out. All in all it was an average experience. Not bad but nothing to brag about.,3
easyautoonline,Overall it was a easy process. However I am very upset that I was sold a ford with mykey on it and wasn't given the admin key to remove it. Now my radio volume has a limit and my speed can not be over 80. When I called the store I was told that was the only key and it would be up to me to get a admin key. They run about 300.00 from the dealership. Nice!!!,3
easyautoonline,Everything went well and everyone was nice and helpful,5

easyautoonline,I have bought 3 cars so far and no issues they worked well serving my needs,5
easyautoonline,"Transmission went bad 2 days after I bought vehicle. Even tho under warranty it has taken almost 3 weeks to get it fixed. I have lost 3 weeks of income from one of my jobs. When I asked about a loaner car I was told in contract says dealership does not offer loaners while warranty work being done.  That's all fine and good in fine print but if a vehicles has a major breakdown as a transmission barely 48hrs I think any worthwhile dealership would step up and help a little more than normal. I was told by a manager ""I have seen cars transmission go bad 3 hours after it's off the lot"" that's laughable . I was not going to leave a review like this but after this experience I decided to write my opinion. I will not buy a car here again.",2
easyautoonline,This is a damn good car runs like a  and I can't complain about it,5
easyautoonline,I did an application on line then called made an appointment. Did all the necessary paperwork. Had my co singer to do their paperwork. Gave my down payment called and got my insurance and I walked out with my new car. I love and enjoy my car very much and plan on going back and getting another one.,5
easyautoonline,"I had such an excellent experience with EasyAuto. The process of being able to do everything online was a godsend- they answered every question I had via email, making it easy when you are constantly on the phone for work. It also meant time in store was minimal. I arrived & the car I wanted was already waiting- I was able to test drive it & they had my paperwork ready to roll. The staff is wonderful- I’d be back to buy from them in a heartbeat!",5
easyautoonline,"The whole experience with Easy Auto, for myself, was amazing!! I searched their inventory online on their website. I seen quite a few cars I wanted to ask about.

The car looks WAY better in person and I couldnt be happier! I am VERY pleased with my EASY AUTO experience.",5

easyautoonline,"They delivered the wrong car completely. The car started breaking down on me as I was driving down the highway, and the only reason I am not giving them a 1 star rating is because they offered to fix the car but we shall see... Its still not the car i chose in the beginning. Do not order one online and have it delivered. Go and pick one out instead.",2

They sold my girlfriend a 2008 Nissan rouge with 150000 miles on it for $13,000 (financed) and it is worth $2,000 at best on blue book. They outright took advantage of her lack of experience with buying cars and our family of four is now suffering for it.",1

She was very knowledgeable. Unfortunately, one of the cars didn't have a logbook and the other needed a service. Even though she said it would be serviced before handover, I think the company should have serviced it beforehand so that it would be ready for us to drive. We gave Sheryl 5 stars for her outstanding service. If the cars had logbooks and being serviced, we definitely would have bought it.",5

queensboro,"I ordered embroidered women's and men's shirts.  The shirt material is of excellent quality.  The embroidery looked perfect on the shirts, the size and colors of the embroidery is beautiful.  I called before ordering to speak with a rep about the size as the chart measurements seemed wrong to me, for example someone who wears size L according to the chart should order 2xl.  The rep told me not to worry that if I was not happy with the sizes, they would make it right for me.  I was nervous so I ordered some smaller than I should have.  When they arrived, the sizes were a little too tight in the chest area and the larger sizes were perfect in the chest but a little longer for my employees.  I called and explained this and I was told no problem; we decided to go with the larger sizes and at no cost to me and no need to return the shirts.I have ordered from other companies and paid the same as I paid here and even more with no guarantees of any kind, especially if it was my error.  Now that I know the correct sizes I need and am confident of the product, Queensboro is the company to go to for my uniform shirts.  Thank you so much for your service.",5

It didn't come as I expected, but it was MY fault for not paying enough attention to the color and fabric. Still, a very high quality order. When I was asked if the order was perfect (they only give two options: perfect or not perfect. Nothing in between...) I selected ""not-perfect."" Again, it was MY fault. Within the hour, I got a call trying to resolve the issue. I told them it wasn't their fault. It was MY fault. And the shirts were good enough for me to wear, and I will (and did) wear them. They wouldn't listen. They gave me store credit for the entire order. I asked them not to, because it wasn't their fault. They still wouldn't listen and gave me the credit. The quality, the selection, the ordering process, the minimum quantities, the ability to put a different logo on every item, are just superb, and their customer service exceeds all expectations.

petrebellion,"I’ve had a number of rugs from pet rebellion and every single one does exactly as it’s supposed to do. Having a husky and a Newfoundland x German shepherd my floors do get muddy, since I’ve had these rugs down they’ve really saved my carpet and it’s so easy to lift them and put them in the washing machine. I’ve just actually bought one for my son and his wife for their Labrador they were so impressed with them. I’d recommend the products all day long, thanks pet rebellion.",5
petrebellion,Excellent quality waterproof seat cover that actually fully protects the car seat from my Staffy's muddy paws and doesn't move around - I will be getting another one for my driver's seat,5
petrebellion,Super comfy rugs. highly recommended. My dog loves it. Thank you.,5
petrebellion,"Wonderful quality of the floor mats. Pleasant underfoot,mud lies on the top therefore very easy to clean.Good communication when I have had queries re delivery.",5

petrebellion,"I had been looking for a dog and cat proof rug for our awkward shaped utility room, I ordered some by the metre pet floor protection, I misunderstood the description and had thought that by ordering 2 mats I would receive one length however I received two pieces. This wasn't a big issue but I just want to let others know what to expect. The description does state that there are grid lines on the reverse of the matting to aid cutting but the only lines are those normally present on the reverse of rubber mats. Overall I'm very happy with the finished result.",4
petrebellion,"A very quick and efficient service with excellent quality items, I’m so pleased with the three items I ordered.",5
petrebellion,"Cut to size mat , exactly what I need for garden entrance to reduce water brought in by dogs. Not washed it as yet.",5
petrebellion,"We purchased a personalised feeding mat and a bowl for our dog. They arrived safely within the estimated delivery date and both are very effective and really neaten up his feeding spot. We are very pleased with them. We consider they actually look better than the images on the website. We particularly like the way in which the stainless bowl insert can be easily removed for cleaning. The whole set-up is very stable and he is able to eat from the bowl easily, without it sliding about.",5
petrebellion,"The products on offer are very good quality and the staff are really helpful.  After ordering online, they were quick to phone and confirm details of the order as there was some uncertainty. Delivery was swift, and the mats we ordered are working well at reducing mud brought in by our two Labradors.",5
petrebellion,Its good and very very good I recently was thoroughly impressed,5
petrebellion,Love the site easy to find what I wanted fast delivery and informative all the way love the mat excellent quality,5
petrebellion,UPDATE : Just had a lovely phonecall regarding this review owners have said i can return which is a lovely gesture Glad their customer service is 100%Regarding thickness I stand by they are really thinDispatch and postage wasquick love the sofa protectors and arm protectors made a big difference not using blankets to cover our sofasNow the runners I was dissapoiinted in really thin and with being on carpet they move and crease I know they are going to drive us crazy over the next few weeks but hey ho ....,3
petrebellion,My dog seems really happy with his new mat 😊(really good quality)❤️,5
petrebellion,No second thought .Excellent company.yes.,5
petrebellion,Ordered a place mat for my puppy. I wanted the order customised more than what was advertised on the website so i called prior to placing the order and spoke to a really friendly lady who checked with the workshop that the mat colour change was possible. The order was delivered quickly and came exactly as requested. Would highly recommend!!!,5
petrebellion,"Great all round company, from the ordering process, to despatch which is so quick. Then fast delivery  being kept up to date ,arriving in good time and order. The products are, as always, 5*cant fault them, every product I have purchased has had this constant high standard.",5
petrebellion,"We have both the settee cover and arm cover, ordered at separate times. Both items are wearing well with daily (sometimes rough use with two dogs). The service has been excellent on both occasions of my purchasing. Would highly recommend.",5
petrebellion,Received updates from Pet Rebellion and the courier re dispatch and delivery of my order andmy sofa covers arrived the next day! They're great.. lovely for us to sit on as well as our staffie. Much better quality than anything I've bought before.. wish I'd found Pet Rebellion sooner!,5
petrebellion,Very fast response when I emailed a question. Fab quality sofa covers. Our dog loves them. Good value .,5
petrebellion,"I ordered the car seat covers and they came promptly the next day. I was really pleased with the covers, they fit perfectly and do a great job.  I then ordered two grey 1 metre sofa covers. They also came the next day. These are also excellent - my dog loves them and no longer scratches to try to make a better bed. My teenage daughter is also a big fan as the covers are very cosy!",5
petrebellion,"1st order large dog bed and dog mat runner,  pleased with quality and quick delivery response.2nd order (based on quality and delivery timings) car seat cover set.  only ordered these items within past 2/3 weeks, too early to give an honest response regarding durability, as car covers were only fitted in situ this week.",5
petrebellion,Absolutely love my Pet Rebellion 'Stop Muddy Paws' mats. I was so happy with the first I bought a second and will definitely be back for more. My Australian Shepherd does not like dog beds and chews blankets so these mats are the perfect 'place/bed' for him. Also great in the car.We have one by the back door and it does such a great job at collecting water and dirt when he comes in from the garden.Have  washed them a few times and still perfect - easy to hoover too. Super fast delivery. Could not recommend enough.,5
petrebellion,"I recently bought the cut to size rug & the dog sofa blanket. Both products are superb- the cut to size tug has been a game changer for our static home entrance and the blanket is, without a doubt, the best blanket i have ever had for dogs- its so soft, robust and attractive. Finding things that make life easier in a tiny home with lots of people and paws is a real treat.Service was easy & fast & i would definitely use again. Great stuff thankyou",5
petrebellion,I bought 2 comfy covers for my leather sofa and they are brilliant.  They barely move and both myself and the dogs love them 👍🏻 I bought the stone colour to go on a chocolate brown sofa and they look lovely 😍 I have them horizontal which I find works better than vertical as they cover the gaps between the cushions. Super fast delivery too 😁Would highly recommend Pet Rebellion and will be buying from them again soon 🤩,5
petrebellion,Good quality mats and other products and speedy delivery.,5
petrebellion,First sofa cover to ever stay in place despite two large boxers doing their best to move it!  Dogs love it so am thinking of buying another one to use between washes! Looks great and stays put! Love it!,5
petrebellion,"Arrived within the time I was given when ordering. Excellent value for the money compared to other similar products I looked at. The sofa cover is wonderful, the moment I unwrapped it the dogs immediately laid down on it! So it is a hit with them...and with a recent guest who sat on the chair with it on and said how cosy it was. I also love that it is portable, it went on the back seat for the dogs when we went on hols and also on the sofa in the lodge we stayed in so the dogs could also sit on there with us! Haven't washed it yet so cannot comment on that. But would definitely recommend.",5
petrebellion,The sofa cover is really nice and soft. Pity they reduced the price the day after I purchased it 🙄,4
petrebellion,"The seat covers are really good, look good and we’re so easy to fit and the great thing was they were delivered very quickly.",5

Plus, their prices are quite reasonable, making it a go-to place for pet owners looking to save some bucks without compromising on quality.All in all, quite good for pet lovers. I can recommend it.",5

They were delivered quickly and well packaged. They look good and my dog likes them too!,5
petrebellion,Brilliant customer service and brilliant products- second time to make purchases and will definitely recommend,5
petrebellion,"Overnight postage and good quality product. I bought the stone colour which is quite pleasant.They seem to be staying put ,so far,which is great.I bought two covers and two arm caps for my 2 1/5 seater settee and put them on sideways and they cover really well.My concern was they would be sweaty for people to sit on but that has not proved a problem.",5
petrebellion,Covers are great quality and have a rubbery backing that grips to the sofa.  The colour is good a dark cream/beige.  The dogs like them and sat on them as soon as I covered the sofa.  The delivery was fast and will definitely go back to Pet Rebellion in the future.,5
petrebellion,"a team of professionals, you have very good employees.  thank you for the good attitude towards your customers, I always turn only to you.",5
petrebellion,"I have two sofa covers and an arm rest cover. I looked at getting sofa covers from another company, but they were double the price and probably not as good quality. These covers do not budge (I have them on leather), despite two dogs and my grandson jumping all over them!! They look good and the dogs love to snuggle up on them (as do I). The customer service at PR is exceptional and nothing is too much trouble. Thank you Tommy. I highly recommend.",5
petrebellion,I bought 2 of the Victorian tile cut to size rugs. There were easy to cut and don’t slip despite some rough play from the dog. I got them to help catch the dirt and prevent slipping on laminate when she comes in wet and dirty from the garden and so it fits the bill perfectly for that. They come up great when hovered although I need to set the hover to a high pile settings and get someone stand on the edges. Can’t comment on washing them yet but I don’t expect that to be a problem. I would recommend these rugs,5
petrebellion,"I have got some of Most of there items, mats, seat covers, car stuff, beds ect. I have had dogs for 45 years and got Lots of stuff, But, this stuff is Great. Chair covers stay put, the rugs wash Great, the food mats are all over the place and my dogs Love the beds. The delivery is Always fast and the manager is SO Nice if you have a question. I have the car Defender to stop my old girl scratching the bumper and a bed/mat on top of that for more comfort. I am about to place another order as my puppy just chewed up a food mat and to get a full boot protector for the car as said puppy gets travel sick  :) You can not go wrong with this company. 100%",5
petrebellion,Fast Delivery product as described although not same colour as pictured more of a neutral colour. Non slip which is what I wanted will see how it washes ..,5
petrebellion,I love this sofa cover!! I was trying normal throws but the smell of the dog was going through onto my fabric sofa and I was having to strip and wash it constantly! Now with this cover the smell doesn’t go through. I’ve ordered another one so I can swap them round and not have to wait until the cover is washed and dried.,5
petrebellion,"We both play golf and, always end up with bits of grass in our car boot… on purchasing the boot liners we don’t have to worry anymore as if any grass goes onto liner, we just take out and shake it off.Also being waterproof they are great as it doesn’t always shine when we play so stops boot becoming wet… and we can wash the liners as wellOrdered one day and delivered the next day.Unbelievable…. Well done. Exceptional service.👍😁😁😁 Pat & Peter.x",5

petrebellion,"It was cheaper buying direct from Pet Rebellion than buying directly on Amazon, even with the extra delivery cost. Ordered in the afternoon and it was with me the following morning. Good quality sofa cover that the dogs really seem to like and have ordered a second cover. They stay in place unlike other covers out there.",5
petrebellion,"Super quick delivery, great product andBrilliant price",5
petrebellion,Excellent service. Customer service really helpful. Quality products every time I’ve ordered something. All products I’ve used are well made and hard-wearing,5
petrebellion,We bought 1 dinner mat which actually is okay but we also bought 1 of the stop muddy paws mat for the door way. If I'm honest it is very flimsy and it curls up in the corners which is very annoying as sometimes you trip on it. Delivery was very good!,3
petrebellion,"Mixed feelings about the products I ordered.Sofa covers - I ordered 3, 2 for sofa and 1 for chair - I’ll be honest, I hate them. It’s too small for a sofa and too big for a chair. And although, they do have some flexibility, it’s not like a blanket that you can tuck in and make fit so they just look a mess. They constantly fall off and are uncomfortable. The one seen in video looks so neat but that is not my reality. I don’t know many dogs that will sit in one single spot so you need to cover the full sofa. These are just not fit for purpose for a normal family 3 seater. They seem to be good quality though and may be perfect for some people, especially if they just need to cover part of a sofa that has a flat back. Anything curved just seems to slip. I understand that the size is done to enable machine washing.Car seat cover - We just got one to try. It seems to fit well and the Velcro is good to put around head rest. It’s just a shame that they do not do one long enough to cover the full back seat with holes for seat belt etc. I know there is a set available where you can get 3 individual covers but I’d just prefer a single one as we have had similar before and worked well.Delivery - This was very quick as the items arrived the next day. Although, it’s a good job we were in as the delivery driver just pulled up and left the packages on doorstep. He did not even knock.Service - The customer service has been good overall though and they are very responsive to queries. On that basis, I would consider purchase of other products in the future if I see anything suitable.",3
petrebellion,"Very fast delivery.Quite weighty seat covers, so no slipping and, with just minimal tucking in, no tugging them off the seat by my furry pup. I washed both them before use so they would smell like the rest of the laundry, and they dried surprisingly quickly on the line.Sadly the pup took a dislike to one cover within 20 minutes, now I know exactly how they are made! The second faired better and he loves it",5
petrebellion,"Excellent quality items in great colours, well packaged and dispatched quickly",5

petrebellion,"Received the car seat carpets the day after ordering. These are the second set to replace the 5 year old ones that have kept my cream leather seats like new, even though I have regularly carried two Labradors. The old covers were not worn out and would probably go on for another 5 years. Incredible value for the money and the best purchase I made with my new car.",5
petrebellion,Very good customer service. All questions answered promptly,5
petrebellion,"Amazing service, ordered sofa protection and arm covers on the afternoon of 18th of May, delivered 19th May in the morning.The quality of the products are brilliant, I have a leather sofa so was a bit concerned it would slip down but it doesn't, and has a good weight to it.",5

petrebellion,"I already own a Pet Rebellion mat and it looks great two years after purchasing. It washes well and doesn't slip on the floor like plastic mats. When my daughter got a dog, I immediately ordered one for her. They are really good value and delivery was very fast.",5
petrebellion,"I received the arm covers and sofa cover in good condition, but When I bought these items I thought that would stay in position on my leather sofa. This is not the case, as when my dog gets on the sofa the cover moves, especially the arm covers. My dog likes to put his paws over the side and the covers move. This was disappointing. The quality of the goods were good.",4
petrebellion,"Absolutely love my car seat carpets, they are fantastic, just take them out of the car, vacuum them and they are back to looking brand new.I have also just bought two of the sofa covers and they are brilliant, protecting my sofa the mishaps of two Labradors while looking great!Brilliant service and will defo recommend to my dog owner friends",5

petrebellion,The service was good and the quality of the products I bought were excellent. Just unfortunate the delivery company were terrible 3 days of being messed about and not turning up when they said the y would,5
petrebellion,I have bought a few things from this company and think the products are excellent.  We have two very adventurous spaniels who get very dirty on their off-lead walks.  These products are really durable and wash well and dry quickly! I also have to say their customer service is brilliant. I had the wrong shipping address on my order as I hadn’t updated Apple Pay and their courier attempted to deliver.  As soon as I realised I contacted them and Tommy organised for the order to be re-directed to arrive the following day at no additional cost and was so helpful.  Definitely recommend this company!,5
petrebellion,"Ordering was easy and was kept updated on the delivery which was fast. I've had several products from them, all very good quality. The car seat covers are brilliant. They are fully washable and easy to put in, saving me time and stress cleaning the car. Recently purchased the XL rug. So fluffy and soft. Perfect size for my conservatory, both keeping my floor clean and paws from getting hurt with the hot sun. Definitely recommend!",5

petrebellion,Great products aa always and fast delivery. x,5
petrebellion,"I've used Pet Rebellion products since my cats were young, about 2013.All the products are well made, durable and stylish.At the time I needed to find mats that were absorbent for my cats and their love of splashing water from their fountains on the living room carpet.The mats also needed to be esthetically pleasing as they had a prominent place.Most cat mats were those rubbish plastic things and so I went on the search for dog mats that weren't covered in bones!That's when I found the dotty placemats in a famous retail store (that rhymes with BK Haxx) and since then I've been hooked on Pet Rebellion items.I'm so happy I've been able to buy direct from Pet Rebellion for the last few years because I've had some of the cut to measure items and larger pieces that you can't buy elsewhere.The muddy paws range has been a hit in our house for not only collecting dirt by the door but we have a large cut to size piece in the hall for the litter trays. It's excellent at holding excess litter until you can vacuum.The Big Softy rugs are so snuggly that they are just as good for human toes as toe beans!I purchased the furniture and arm rest cover recently and it's massive! I bought it for our large leather chair but it's actually nearly the size of the 2 seater sofa!It sits really well on the leather and the sticky back helps keep it in place.It does drag down eventually, but it's no where near as often as the throws we use (and I'm using heavy weighted blankets!)Love love love Pet Rebellion and so do my Ragdolls, don't be fooled by the doggies in the photos, kitties, rabbits and humans will love them too!",5
petrebellion,"I ordered black runner for my kitchen to stop muddy paws from garden. It was lovely, thick with a great pattern. My dog loves sitting on it. Hoovers well and doesn't ride up. Will be ordering more from Pet Rebellion.",5
petrebellion,"we had a problem with the carpet ""STOP MUDDY PAWS BY THE METRE – VICTORIAN TILE"" that was delivered,we should have contact Pet Rebellion before doing a review.but Pet Rebellion contacted us about our review to sort out the order, we sent a couple of photos of the  carpet to show the issues.They emailed back very quickly, about the stock not being in to replace the carpet,and offered to refund the order.10/10 for customer service, so if you have problem with your order get in contact with them.we had ordered previously from them without any problems",4
petrebellion,"I ordered the car seat carpet when I saw there was a special deal. Ordering was easy, the delivery was quick & efficient. When the product came it was excellent quality & more importantly did what efficiently what it advertised. So happy with the car seat carpet, I ordered the rest of the set. Have already recommended to family",5

petrebellion,The rugs and mats are made of durable materials and come in a variety of sizes and colors to suit different needs and preferences but I'm not quite sure if the price tag is justified.,3

petrebellion,"I was hoping to find some more unique pet products that I couldn't find at other stores, but I didn't really come across anything that stood out to me. But I still think that Pet Rebellion is worth checking out.",3
petrebellion,First heard about the company at a local dog show. They have some nice products on the website and are good quality.I had an issue with a cover I purchased about 6 months ago. Spoke to Tommy via email and he sent another one out free of charge with no need to send the original one back.,5
petrebellion,Brilliant service. I bought the cut to size rugs and they are fabulous. They don't slide across the floor and they are easy to clean. I would definitely recommend these to other people.,5
petrebellion,"great dinner mat for Ollie Dog.  He drinks and then walks away leaving a trail of water around the kitchen - but no more, this mat catches all drops.",5
petrebellion,"I have received my order,thank you",4
petrebellion,"Ordered three items, a cost rug a cut to size Victorian tile rug and a flat dog bed on the 1st April and these were delivered on the 6th by DX . Received notification on the day of the time slot and they arrived during this time. Products are fit for purpose and the flat dog bed got my dog’s approval straight away. I would order again and recommend to others. I did look at the seat cover but unfortunately would not fit on my L shaped sofa on the part I wanted to use it for, could you maybe do a make a different size as the 100cm was too wide. I have 4 dogs so would be iseful",5
petrebellion,"Second purchase. Had an issue this time, excellent customer service.",4
petrebellion,As always Pet Rebellion gave 5 star service. The rugs I ordered were delivered in no time and I am very pleased with the. Thank you,5

The covers for my leather sofa ordered previously wash up lovely and are a god send after using throws which just kept falling on the floor. Wish I had found them earlier !",5
petrebellion,"I have bought 3 car seat carpets now and they are excellent.  They look and work so much better than a blanket to protect the seat from the dogs.  The back of the seat is also protected, which it wasn’t with a blanket.  Fast service too!",5
petrebellion,"Order made on Sunday evening, arrived on Tuesday at time stated by delivery company.  The comfy seat cover is good quality and our dog gave her immediate seal of approval by sleeping on it for hours. It is a similar material to her calming bed. Received a free mini mate feeding mat which is lovely. I would be very happy to order from this company again.",5
petrebellion,"This was the first time I've bought Pet Rebellion mats direct from the company, having done so previously from pet shops. I found ordering very easy and dispatch was prompt with delivery updates. The mats are great quality, long- lasting and good value for money. They were bought to replace their 10 yr old+ predecessors.The free mini mat was a very useful addition.",5
petrebellion,Very quick and product as what says. Had to wash item within 24hr or receiving and washed in the washing machine. Fantastic idea. This is a game changer. After buying carpet mats for years for my dogs to destroy within the 24hr period this has lasted a week and still going stronge.,5
petrebellion,I cannot recommend Pet Rebellion enough. I received a mat that had a slight fault in it and when I contacted them they said they'd send a replacement out.This was yesterday morning and we took delivery of the new one this afternoon.Thank you so much.I'll certainly use you again.Karen Alder,5

This was during the festive holidays and even though the company was closed, Tommy kept in touch to ensure my order had been received.That's what you call customer service.",5
petrebellion,"I bought a country walk dog runner last week for my hallway after reading reviews and it seeming a good idea instead of having towels on the floor.  I love the design, and am no longer embarrassed opening the front door to visitors! My only comment is that as it is impossible to get the crease out where it was folded in the packaging, however I have been assured by Pet Rebellion that they are reviewing their packaging this year.",4
petrebellion,Products from pet rebellion are of great quality and good value.  Had an issue with the long runner lifting at the edges and catching under the door.  It does a great job of catching muck - just not great if your door has little clearance underneath.  Contacted customer service and was immediately offered a refund.  Would highly recommend this company not just for its product quality but also for its excellent customer service which is so lacking today with many on line retailers.,5
petrebellion,Have the grey sofa cover which I use lengthwise on our two and half seater sofa. Works well and washes in normal size washing machine. Good quality and quick delivery. Ordered two arm covers. Could be a tad bigger but put them on so that they stay in place and covers most of the arms. Would recommend.,5
petrebellion,"I had a recommendation from another customer on social media, when asked about reducing muddy paw prints in the home. I have a cocker spaniel & labrador whom have full access to the garden throughout the day.I put this near the back door in the hopes of getting a little off their feet then a normal runner as our kitchen is quite large.As it's grey you can clearly see it's doing its job well! I've washed it & it's come out great,  it's not taken  long to dry either.I'm that impressed I've just ordered 3 meters of the black/paw to cover a larger area & remove my other runner.I will now move this grey to the front hall where we have less foot traffic but it looks so nice  & I know it will do the job.I wish I'd found this sooner, 2 dogs, 7 humans & numerous visitors. I'm really pleased to have something that really does do what it says on the box!Oh excellent service & speedy delivery too",5
petrebellion,Absolutely amazing customer service and product.  First time used this company. Ordered 22.12 received 23.12! Highly recommend and will definitely use again,5
petrebellion,"Didn’t have to wait long for delivery,I was pleasantly surprised how thick the cover was ,I have spent money on other cover before & this one is far superior, it stays put much better than others ,is comfy to sit on , I’m really pleased  so I ordered another one .",5
petrebellion,"FURTHER EDIT: 4 January 2023DHL have finally delivered my order. Pet Rebellion have also been in contact with me so I’m upgrading my score to 4* on that basis. The quality of the products is excellent as always.Original review and previous update below:Order not received. Pet Rebellion use DHL for delivery. DHL customer services are utterly useless/non existent. Have emailed them twice and phoned customer services several times over the past week but you can’t actually speak to a person. There’s not even an option to be put through to a person. Parcel is now a week late, every time I call DHL and go through all the options I eventually get an automated voice message saying my parcel is at the depot and will be ‘loaded on the van for delivery today’ That’s happened for 3 days in a row!  No communication at all from DHL to say parcel is out for delivery. Tracking info still says parcel due to be delivered on Friday 16 December, which it wasn’t. DHL auto message also says to contact sender.I’ve copied in Pet Rebellion on one of my emails to DHL, I’ve also phoned them several times.  Nobody answers, the phone just rings and rings and then cuts me off. If they’ve finished up for Christmas there is no message to advise their customers of the fact.It’s a shame as I have ordered from Pet Rebellion several time before and the goods and service have been excellent. However on this occasion it has been a bad experience. I appreciate that Pet Rebellion are not responsible for DHL’s incompetence, however the fact that I’ve also emailed them and had no reply and they don’t answer the phone is very disappointing.Update:I have since been contacted by Pet Rebellion off the back of this review. They have offered to help where they can. They had not received my previous email (may have been rejected by their server?) and are now closed for Christmas. They have confirmed their website should reflect this closure but I was unable to find anything and have asked them to point me in the right direction. I still think an answer phone message on their contact line confirming ‘closed until X date’ would be really helpful for customers. However, as I think is clear in my review the primary issue is with DHL.",4
petrebellion,The slim seat carpet set we ordered arrived very quickly and covers the back seat of our car perfectly. I had phoned for advice before ordering and it was very helpful. It is very easy to fit and easy to remove and shake out to keep clean. It doesn’t move at all when our dog jumps in or if she changes position. It is brilliant and we wish we had found Pet Rebellion sooner!,5
petrebellion,Excellent product and great customer service. Very pleased with the whole experience. Highly recommended 👍🏻,5
petrebellion,Ordered the sofa cover & arm rest and boot liner. Products came quickly and very impressed with the quality and the look of the products. So impressed ordered another cover & arm rest for the other side of the settee. Great company thank you so much would recommend highly and would have no hesitation in ordering again.,5
petrebellion,Ordered a mat and settee cover. Dog does not like the cover but in fairness it is good quality so not the fault of the product. The mat is yet to be tried.,4

New puppy loves it, and our new sofa thanks him for it!",5

petrebellion,"I ordered the cut to fit mat.It arrived in good time and is a good size.I cut the mat to fit into the door and that was easy to do.I walked the dog and dried him on the mat on our return. He walked into the kitchen and he left wet prints all over the place, not impressed and the mat is not cheap.It doesn’t feel any different from any other rug and does not dry my dogs paws.I was thinking about getting another mat for his food and water but I don’t think I’ll bother now.",3
petrebellion,Great choice and prices and arrived really quickly. Mats look good down and are protecting my floors. They are well made and I will buy more in the future.,5

petrebellion,My gorgeous dog loves loves loves his comfy cover,5
petrebellion,I ordered several products including the sofa cover and the cut to fit mat.Mat was easy to cut and is a good size. I have struggled to find a mat big enough for the area I wanted to put it in.I have turned the sofa cover long ways and it fits the whole width of my 3 seater sofa. I have 2 dogs and one likes to sit on one side of me and the other dog on the other side! It is thick and comfortable but the tufty fabric feels kind of strange like it has a coating on it.Still appears to be good quality and I would recommend so 5 stars.Delivery to NI took a bit longer than I hoped but was pretty quick.,5

petrebellion,"Pet Rebellion are fantastic! Car seat covers are brilliant for both front and back seats, I definitely recommend them, they certainly keep the inside of my car much more clean.The sofa covers are also marvellous, warm and soft, our 3 westies snuggle up on them and so do we!!!If I have to find fault with goods from Pet Rebellion, it would be the muddy paws runner, it needs to be double the width for my kitchen floor, maybe I should buy another to sit alongside the one we  already have, but would they stay together?!!!Great service, great products, thank you Pet Rebellion, I'm waiting to see what's coming next!!Carol.",5
petrebellion,"I brought the 3 piece rear car set protector , the quality is good but the fitment in my car is very poor, I have a Mercedes GLA and the rear headrests are moulded into the seat backs so the Velcro straps are not long enough to go round and secure the covers, real shame but wont sit in place , i should have checked before purchasing",3
petrebellion,Update 16.19 - I had a call from the company and was dealt with very professionally . I have been offered a full refund and p&p will be covered. Overall good service after my initial issues raised.Very disappointed with a purchase of 2 dog sofa mats. Quite expensive but quality was not particularly good and didn’t not fit well over our sofa. Not happy at all and to top it off p&p not included and to return it costs me again!,4
petrebellion,Have had two orders both high quality and Harris loves having his own carpets he so cosy  on them x,5
petrebellion,"The cover was ordered around 3pm in the afternoon and arrived at 10am the following morning!More importantly, my bull terrier Tilly loves it, and it looks great on our brown sofa.Thank you!",5
petrebellion,Very good product great quality will purchase from you again,5

petrebellion,Again I bought the same one and I I'm delighted with both products,5
petrebellion,Excellent product! Fits well and excellent customer service,5
petrebellion,"I bought the sofa cover and arm protectors, after years of trying all sorts of throws, loose covers and blankets. I was concerned that this would either slide like everything else or look like I had thrown the doormat on the sofa. However these are working very well so far against a small, digging dog and and a large kicking dog plus a slouching husband. They are heavy enough to actually stay put and fluffy enough to be comfortable and look nice. I am considering buying a spare set.",5

petrebellion,Brilliant service - came next day! Lovely product and is perfect for our sofa and for our Springer!! Thank you,5
petrebellion,Fast prompt delivery service. Covers for sofa and arms are ok but constantly come off as the No slip back doesn’t seem to grip. Tried on both fabric and leather which makes no difference. Could do with something like big elastic band type thing to hold it in place. Apart from that dogs like lying on them for there comfort,4
petrebellion,"first time using your company excellent service, next day delivery and quality items .",5
petrebellion,I had a question before purchasing product and asked as question this was promptly answered so I placed order and product arrived the next day. Snuggle blanket is heavier than expected but stays in place on my leather sofa & non stop pads haven’t marked the leather. Plus the dogs love it.,5
petrebellion,Great customer care & service. This is my 5/6 product from Pet Rebellion. They are all great 😊,5

petrebellion,"Perfect, they care about animals",5
petrebellion,"Hi all, I have recently bought one of the single seat covers, used it on my own seat as protection as I hate the normal slip on ill fitting slippery ones, far too good for the dog to sit on, very comfortable, nice design, looks great, well made and so far doing it's job, also velcro fits around the headrest so it's put on or taken off in seconds and can be rolled up and stored in the boot when not required, also as far as I know it's waterproof and can be washed, what's not to like, very happy and will definately buy another IF this one eventually wears out, thanks to all the guys at Pet Rebellion for solving my seat cover problems. Well worth the money, oh by the way I'm sure dogs will love it too!!.",5

petrebellion,I saw the pet blanket on Facebook and decided it was just what I was looking for. It arrived promptly and is excellent quality with little nobbles on the back which stop it slipping. As soon as I put it on the sofa my dog jumped up on it and has hardly moved since. I was going to try putting it the other way round i.e. down the rear of the sofa across the seat but every time I try he jumps up on it so I guess that’s how he likes it! I thought it was good value too.,5
petrebellion,Ordered delivered kept well informed re delivery fits my Renault captur well,5
petrebellion,"Absolutely brilliant products at reasonable prices, this is my third order",5

petrebellion,"Was initially disappointed with my second purchase of a sofa cover in August 2022, it was of a poorer quality and different colour when compared with an ‘identical’ style of cover I bought in July 2022. However, Pet Rebellion did go out of their way to find me another cover from an earlier batch for which I am extremely grateful.",4
petrebellion,Best mats that you can buy. Recommended!,5
petrebellion,"Excellent service, delivery informed at each stage of progress. The seat protectors were such good quality that I ordered the boot defender as well for when my son's Cocker Spaniel comes with my two dogs as well.",5
petrebellion,"Brilliant seat cover/carpet, arrived as stated, well packaged and, in my opinion, great value for money. Fitted it in me car, only problem I found was my seat is a sports seat so no headrest for the straps to go around, still worth it though.",5
petrebellion,"Very fast delivery quality looks good, will find out more over the next few months",5
petrebellion,"I found this website by chance & loved all of the pet items for my dog.I bought the floor mat which I can cut to size - it is made very well & will keep the kitchen floor dry around her bowls.I also bought a throw with extra bits for the sofa arms - it’s soft, comfy (for me & my pup - who’s 11 😁) & doesn’t move around too much like other throws can/do.Delivery was very quick & the website was easy to navigate, even the purchases themselves- I would recommend",5
petrebellion,"So pleased with my purchase. Couldn't believe how quickly it came.So much better than throws, as I was always having to straighten the throw if someone sat on it.Will definitely be ordering another one when payday is here.Have already recommended it to people at work.",5
petrebellion,"I so love this company, their website and especially the products.  The softee rug is so snuggly that my girls didn’t get it as I’ve now put it at the side of my bed and it’s sooo lovely to step on when getting out of bed.  The comfy sofa covers are wonderful and so good for keeping the sofa free from dirt and muddy paws and so easy and quick to wash.  I also got the sofa arm covers which are a fantastic idea especially as my youngest little one has taken to laying on the arms of the sofa.",5
petrebellion,"Easy to use website, arrived quickly and best of all the dogs love it.  The non slip back of the mat is brilliant it really doesn't budge unless you pick it up.  It's easy to clean to so that's always a bonus.",5
petrebellion,Fantastic items just as described & despatched quickly. Very high quality looks much more expensive than it was,5
petrebellion,"Purchased a comfy cover grey, fantastic item, fits on the sofa perfectly, will recommend and purchase again.",5
petrebellion,Good quality product. Have the sofa covers which wash well. These just finish off the sofas.,5
petrebellion,"I purchased the Comfy Cover (Grey), along with the Dinner Mate in Dotty Grey, from Pet Rebellion.The Comfy Cover is a generous size, no slipping.  Beautiful, thick and soft, yet substantial. The colour is a lovely warm grey.  My little dog is snoozing on his new cover happily right now, along with his stuffed toy, 'Baby.'The Mat is perfect for his food stand, and absorbs doggy drools well as he waits to begin eating!  Again, a lovely colour, good size, no slipping and light enough to pop into the washing machine.A problem with courier delivery was acted on quickly and efficiently by Tommy at Pet Rebellion. He telephoned me with an update, followed by email.  Very impressive!I would highly recommend Pet Rebellion for service, communication and products.  Would definitely purchase again.",5

petrebellion,It was easy to order and the delivery was on time and well organised,5

petrebellion,This is the first order from petrebellion which came quickly and the seat cover for the car is brilliant it fits well and stays in place but is easy to brush off when all the grass and grit comes into the car. The water bowl mats are great just the right size. Will order again.,5
petrebellion,"Ordering is simple but DHL managed to deliver my parcel to the wrong street !!The seat covers are very good quality and fit really well.We bought our first set last year and they are still like new, so we bought another set for our 2nd car.   They are nice to sit on, for dogs and rear seat passengers.Very impressed.",5

petrebellion,"I ordered a full set of covers for the back of the car. I tried to order an extra floor mat for a discount price but couldn’t get the link to work (still not sure if it was me or the link that failed miserably!) I contacted the team at Pet Rebellion and they sent me the floor mat free of charge with my order. The mats arrived quickly and we were pleased with them although 1 had not been sewn correctly but I did not send it back as I was able to sew this myself. The mats seem good quality and fit our Peugeot 608 well. My husband’s comment was that it would be nice to have Velcro on the sides of the mats so they cannot be lifted by the dogs enabling the dirt to still reach the seats however, I didn’t expect that and I have left our old hammock and towels underneath to catch anything that goes through the meeting of the mats! There is a good overlap on the mats so I don’t think much will penetrate to the seats underneath. I’m pleased with my purchase!",5
petrebellion,"A fantastic service, straight forward website, easy to use and great delivery. I'm really happy with the quality of the mat and car seat protector fits well, nice touch having the option to personalise the food mat too. Would highly recommend:))",5

petrebellion,"Very impressed by both the customer service at Pet Rebellion and the quality of their products. I bought two of the sofa covers and love them so bought two more for when I need to wash them, they’re cosy and look good but most importantly they keep muddy paw prints off the sofa. I also bought a set of car seat covers for the back of the car and they’re really excellent. Will be back for more items soon!",5

petrebellion,"Excellent quality dog covers. I purchased a new car and was somewhat surprised at the cost and quality of a rear seats cover set. These are more like a carpet, really easy to fit, vacuum well, mud dries quickly then easy to remove. Dogs claws don’t seem to damage the covers as it’s so thick. I bought the three seat set, with the slim cut for the middle seat, easy to remove for passengers worried about dog hair but our dog does not shed. Very good value for money and excellent quality.",5
petrebellion,"Ordered a few bits and was really happy. My cats get spoilt all the time by me and my husband so buying a few gifts from this company was a no brainer. Quality made stuff, really pleased.",5
petrebellion,"First time using this great company.  Ordered 2 seat covers 100/170cm.

petrebellion,"Great product, good price and quick delivery.",5
petrebellion,"I purchased the complete car set. They are well worth the money. Absolutely beautiful looking and feeling, they make my car so tidy as well rather than before with the other car seat covers I had. I would advise everybody to buy these mats. Maybe expensive to begin with but in the long run it's you that will definitely benefit from them, their look, their durability and their comfort for your fur baby.",5
petrebellion,"Another great purchase from Pet Rebellion! Excellent customer service, fast delivery, fantastic products. I buy all my mats for home and vehicle from this company.",5

petrebellion,"I bought the cut to size mat, it is perfect and easy to keep clean and has really helped stop muddy feet coming on my flooring as I have 5 dogs,",5
petrebellion,"Can’t fault this company. I made my first order and it arrived promptly. I was really happy with the product so I ordered another one of the same mats and had also received a coupon code for my next order. Delivery was even quicker this time - it came the very next day at no extra cost! The quality of the products is superb and exactly as described. I’m not one for leaving reviews much as I usually forget, but this company is so fantastic, I actively sought out to review them.",5
petrebellion,"Wow, I ordered and already got my order the next day. I cannot remember when I ever had such a quick turnaround.The quality of the products is great, ordered car seat covers and the flat polka bed. My dog really loves the bed and it is also the perfect size for the car boot, so my dog can have it comfy.The car seat covers are a little bit too wide for our Mercedes C-Class, but they are ""one size fits all"", so not too worried about that. Rather too big than too small.Prices are more than okay for the quality you receive in my opinion and I could support a UK business.",5
petrebellion,"This is a brilliant company which instinctively knows what dog owners need whether it’s robust mats for feeding, rugs that can be littered with treats or car seat protectors. We have them all and they are still in mint condition after many tumbles in the washing machine and our dog sat watching the machine unhappily waiting for their mat to come back out!We are so thrilled with the car seats protectors as our dog sheds terribly so it really keeps the car seats clean.",5
petrebellion,"Great experience, Great quality, Fast delivery. This is my second purchase with next day delivery.The door runner is great for dirty paws especially as we have 4 Great DanesThey also love the Comfy sofa cover",5
petrebellion,Ordered the sofa cover and it was delivered within 2 days. Excellent quality and very well made. Highly recommended 👌.,5

petrebellion,"I ordered the comy cover for my sofa. It is smart, stays in place and definitely looks better than the throw we were using. It covers almost 2 seats of my 3 seater sofa. Lucy the Cocker Spaniel has given it the sniff test and it meets with her approval. She loves snoozing on it!This is my fifth order from Pet Rebellion and everything I have received are good quality products. Speedy Delivery too.",5

petrebellion,Just received the middle seat cover for the car have had the others for a number of years. These narrow covers fill the gap beautifully really pleased with them. The older covers wash really well,5
petrebellion,"We have several of the pet Rebellion seat covers for my dog walking van, and mats in our house and campervan and they are great, very lightweight and machine washableWe've just recently purchased two of the large sofa covers and our two working cockers absolutely love them, to a point that they no longer want to sleep on our own bed, but would prefer to spend the night on the sofa insteadEveryone's a winner with happy dawgs🐾🐾",5
petrebellion,"Ordered a set of car seat covers.  They are ok - just ok really.  My car has leather seats, and having seen the images on the website of the covers being used on a leather car seat I thought they would be perfect.  They do most of what they say but they do slide around quite a lot if your dog moves meaning my leather seats are exposed a bit.  They are also quite thin - I expected them to be a bit thicker and heavier duty than what they are, especially when I paid around £70 for them.  I will continue to use them though, and expect they will be better in terms of slipping around when used on fabric seats.",4
petrebellion,Ordered muddy paws cut to size mat for the back door and comfy sofa cover.  Very pleased with both. Great quality and arrived very quickly.  Thanks,5
petrebellion,"Lovely dog food mat, just what I wanted. Excellent service, my personalised mat arrived the very next day after ordering. Would highly recommend",5

petrebellion,Firstly I wanted to buy a dog bed which had been made in the UK. Really impressed with the quality of the dog bed recently ordered from Pet Rebellion. Wanted a washable basket and this bed has removable washable covers so hopefullythey come off and go back on easily. My dog took to the bed immediately and clearly loves sleeping in it. It is very supportive. Received the bed within 4 days of ordering online.,5
petrebellion,"Was really pleased with my order ,it was delivered very promptly and my dog Kobi loves it however we haven't got it onthe settee as yet as he loves laying on it on the floor. Would definitely recommend.",5
petrebellion,"I ordered the big paws floor mat and a drying mitt for our black Labrador. He’s a big boy and like most Labs loves mud and water, so he’s rinsed off daily! The mat is superb and takes the wet off his paws as he walks over it. I’m just about to order more of the drying mitt! It’s so good we realise that we need one on each hand when drying, plus one or two in the car! Excellent delivery and service from Pet Rebellion, many thanks!",5
petrebellion,"Brought the sofa cover after checking measurements but too small so had to return it, but the buyer beware you have to pay return postage, which was expensive. I got refunded but not for postage. The cover is for a single seat section does not cover even a 2-seater sofa.*Response to reply below*If that is the case regarding only covering half a sofa this should be made clear in the description to avoid further disappointment.",2
petrebellion,"We needed a new larger mat inside our back door for our Black Labrador as he would drag mud and water in from outside, this appeared as if by magic on my Facebook feed, after a little investigation we decided this Big Paws mat was just perfect, it's very attractive as well as efficient an we're extremely pleased, service was fast with delivery in less than 2 days!

petrebellion,"I have always been sceptical ordering from companies advertising on Facebook and left a comment saying this. After being reassured that Pet Rebellion are a company to be trusted I took my chance and ordered a cover for the front seat of my car. Less than twenty four hours after ordering the cover arrived, firstly the cover is top quality and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. But this provides more than protection to my front seat, my twelve year old lurcher Stanley is no longer able to jump into the back of my car to travel but can manage to get in the front footwell but needs to climb on the seat to get out. The cover provides perfect protection to my seat and Stanley is able to travel happily in the front to go for his walk in the woods.Thank you Pet Rebellion",5

petrebellion,"Everything is made very well and has been thought out very well for ease and convenience.

petrebellion,"Purchased the comfy cover for my very large, very lazy dog and she absolutely loves it.As she is a rescue dog that was kept outdoors I like her to be as warm and cozy as possible. This ticked all the boxes!",5
petrebellion,"we have many mats at our doors ,even in the car port where the puppy seems to like laying down, we have food mats under his dishes indoors and outside ,the tartan are very nice change from our older spotty ones which we've placed in the caravan ready for travelling.in the car we have the boot mat and seat mat which are both the new style as our old ones were replaced as the backing kept crumbling replaced by Tommy with no arguments at all,great customer service always from the team.I can not recommend them enough. !! keep it up guys.",5
petrebellion,This is the 1st time I have ordered from Pet Rebellion and have been very impressed. I ordered on the Monday evening 5 days before Christmas and my order arrived on the Wednesday! I'm particularly impressed with the sofa cover. Will probably order the car seat protectors next.,5
petrebellion,Love all your products.  I have two labradoodles puppies and can't thank you enough for the hard waring products that I have purchased.  Car and home products are hard waring and great value for the money.Can't tank you enough,5

petrebellion,Brill ordered a few things everything been spot on 👍👌 will definitely be buying again,5
petrebellion,"Purchased the fluffy cover for the couch as it stated that it didn't slip, however after a couple of washes it does slip. Though I have to say not as much as other covers I have tried. I have 3 small dogs who love it, so I would still recommend. Arrived promptly & keeps its appearance, due to the fact that it does slip more sideways than down, I have taken off a star !",4
petrebellion,"Brilliant customer service, replacement given with no hassle.Recommended to a friend who is also happy with service and quality.",5
petrebellion,Great company to order from easy to navigate site and friendly staff when I've needed to speak to the would definitely recommend and I have used this site several times. Keep up the good work.,5
petrebellion,Like everything from pet rebellion … excellent quality at a very reasonable price … highly recommend this company 5⭐️,5
petrebellion,"Excellent prompt service. The comfy throw washes and retains its shape well, it does slip a little but as my settee is a recliner I did expect some movement but still less than the previous throws I have used. The door rug is fantastic and unbelievable how much dirt it catches on the way in from a muddy walk. Again this washes up lovely and dries quickly which is a bonus. Certainly look at getting a larger one for the front door.",5
petrebellion,I have bought three Pet Rebellion mats in the last couple of years. They have served me well and absorb the muddy water from when my (large) dogs come in from the garden. Well worth the money.,5

petrebellion,"Have just bought my dream (2nd hand) bmw i3. I ordered the 2 large and 1 slim seat for the back seats. The slim seat is superfluous as the 2 standard seat covers almost meet. I was worried that the carpet material may be itchy / uncomfortable, but it's not. Have already used it in anger, as my partner unfortunately slipped on some very muddy ground today. Just to note, the seats covers don't fit on the front seats; as the head rest configuration is different. Partner relegated to the back seats! Very pleased.",5

petrebellion,Excellent product & service.  Quick delivery & good communication.,5
petrebellion,"These sofa covers are just fabulous! I have 2 for my leather sofas and I have 4 crazy terriers!

They are beautifully made, soft and fluffy and comfy to sit on. Really can’t praise these enough! The doggos love them!",5

petrebellion,Very pleased with the car seat covers and they look good. Customer Service and delivery excellent.,5
keystonepuppies,"My experience with Keystone puppies and the breeder B. King was excellent. Mr. King responded very quickly to our request and followed up multiple times, including after the adoption process to make sure Pluto was doing well.  We adopted Pluto on September 26, 2023. Our experience brought us to Mr. King’s home to pick up the puppy. We were welcomed into his home. The Experience could not have been better. I would definitely look toward adopting another puppy from the Keystone website, and Mr. King in the future. It was a pleasure. Thank you very much.",5

Our puppy Maverick (formerly known as Marz) is well trained on potty pads, so sweet, loving, healthy, and adorable. We also had a great experience with Shawn. He had quick communication and sent us flight updates as Maverick made his way to us. We also got to keep the nice kennel that he was shipped in. Sadie also sent a bag of food, a collar, and the papers with the puppy. Overall, we had an awesome experience!",5
keystonepuppies,"There was another couple scheduled for the same time as we were. The environment was dismal, Chaz was dirty, smelly. He had giardia and has been treated for 3 months. We didn’t see his mother or father. Also, the woman handling the transaction asked for $100 more than was posted online. Yogi does have an excellent disposition, smart and social. He adapted to our home quickly.",2

She was bathed and ready to go when we got there.  Gave us a small bag of food.  Took her to the vet within 10 days.  She did have a parasite common for puppies breeder paid for the antibiotics. The experience was great Ginger is thriving.  A wonderful addition to our family.  Another family member and friend have gotten puppies from her since then.,5
keystonepuppies,"I’d always heard derogatory comments about getting puppies from the Amish, however I had several people tell what a great resource Keystone puppies was to find a puppy.  I searched for a while and appreciated the info keystone had on the breeder.   I selected a puppy that Ruth Smucker was offering.  Ruthie was extremely helpful to work with.  I contacted her via email and she was very quick to reply.  I was able to pay my deposit via Venmo.  I brought home a very beautiful. Frisky pup that fit right into my life.  I’ve taken her to the vet and she has a clean bill of health.  Overall my experience was very positive.",5

This fall, we decided to find her a friend since our elder yorkie had passed. We came upon mini Aussiedoodle, Archie and my in laws living in PA, went to visit him and FaceTimed us.

keystonepuppies,"I'm delighted to express that Luna (Luelle), the friendly and outgoing Toy Goldendoodle from The King's, has brought immense joy to my home. The process of making her a part of the family, from decision to arrival, took just 5 days, spanning from Pennsylvania to Washington. Upon her arrival at the airport, I took her out of the crate, placing her in my lap for the 5-hour journey home. During the initial 90 minutes, she peacefully slept, and then her vibrant personality began to shine.Luna's first action upon reaching our home was using the potty mat promptly. It's been nearly a month, and she has proven to be the most outgoing and friendly puppy I've ever had. I look forward to her upcoming training, and I'm genuinely thankful for the joy she has brought into my life. Thank you!",5

keystonepuppies,I've reached out to several owners who post puppies for sale and a majority do not respond to inquiries. The ones that have responded say they puppy posted for sale is no longer available but they have others that are not posted anywhere on the site. They then try and charge three times the price. It feels like a platform for puppy hustlers.,1
keystonepuppies,"From finding my puppy on the website, connecting with the breeder and getting puppy here, it could not have gone smoother. My healthy,adorable puppy is a life changer",5
keystonepuppies,"kudos to Keystone Puppies for having such a good website and kudos to Mary Zook for raising such beautiful puppies.  Mary was very accommodating to my schedule and could not have been nicer. Rosie (formerly Rabbit) is the sweetest, smartest, precious mini golden doodle EVER!",5

This was my first experience with doing something like this and I was a little nervous but I’m glad it was a good one, the breeder was knowledgeable and understanding of the fact I had to pick up my baby a few days after the purchase date and he agreed to keep her and take care of her until I could get to her to bring her home. When I came for her he was ready and had her health records ready and even sent a bag of food along with her.  I have been singing the praises of Keystone Puppies to EVERYONE I know who is looking to add a fur baby to their family!! Thank you thank you THANK YOU 🐶🐾🦴",5
keystonepuppies,It was a good experience and I got a fantastic healthy loving puppy. Couldn't be happier,5

We have a 2 year old female who is absolutely amazing and the sweetest girl, and a lovely 4 month old male who is the most lovable goofball!  Both pups are extremely healthy and adjusted great to our family.  Each person we interreacted with at Keystone was kind, professional and super helpful.  Great people all around.",5
keystonepuppies,I was skeptical at first of getting my puppy through a breeder as I have rescued my previous dogs but John King was great and gave an excellent experience. The process was quick and easy. I showed up he let me see Teddy and spend as much time as I wanted. After that we signed papers and he gave all health visit paperwork to me in a folder to bring to the vet. He also gave a bag of food. I brought Teddy to the vet after having him for one week and he is perfectly healthy and up to date! Thank you keystone puppies and my breeder John King for such an easy process on getting my puppy Teddy!,5
keystonepuppies,"The environment where we went to purchase Barney was meticulous. All the dogs seemed playful and happy. Linda was beautiful and so accommodating. Sam was a pleasure to speak with over the phone. Barney, now Hunter, has thrived growing quickly inside and out displaying such confidence and as the vet said happiness. He’s is also so affectionate with an adorable personality. Beautiful breeding! We’re grateful❤️🐾",5
keystonepuppies,Being able to contact the breeder and see the puppy before purchasing was a really good idea. This Breeder was sure to have all of the puppy's (Mojo) vaccinations up to date and provided us with a folder of important information.  It was a nice touch to include a bag of food that the puppy was used to eating.,5
keystonepuppies,The breeder communicated well and was very nice. I was able to pick up my puppy and take him home in time for the holidays. 🩷,5

keystonepuppies,I was a little skeptical about this website because the prices were just too good to be true! I texted the seller but never got a response so I was like I knew it was a scam. My husband ended up calling the number (turns out the seller did not have texting on his plan) We purchased a YoriePoo for an amazing price & our baby is healthy and very energetic(13wks now). We drove to PA to get him & the dealer was very pleasant & nice. We received all the paperwork for him. I’m very glad my husband called the number because we’d still be looking for a YorkiePoo.,5

keystonepuppies,"Giving our boy ""Dash"" his forever home was a wonderful experience! The Keystone Puppies website was informative and easy to use to research Puppies and breeders. Breeder Jacob Speicher responded to our voice-mail within the hour, and we were on our way to meet our little guy.

We were very pleased with the whole experience.",5
keystonepuppies,"The puppy is such s joy, in good health with updated vaccines, and the Fishers couldn't have been kinder.  Also, the price was reasonable and ""Flower""was bathed and sweet smelling.  She is a typical pup and so intelligent!   - - Thank you Keystone Puppies!",5

keystonepuppies,"My husband and I have been wanting to get a pug for so many years and stumbled upon Keystone Puppies! We were thrilled that this organization requires accredited breeders, does site visits, offers health guarantees, and more! One of our big concerns living in PA is the abundance of puppy mills so we wanted to be sure we were buying from a reputable source to ensure the best health possible for our dog. We LOVE our puppy that we got from breeder Sarah out in Oxford, PA! We've had numerous vet visits already and everything looks good so far! Our boy is already 12 pounds, knows 10 different tricks, and is the most polite puppy we've known! :D 1000% recommend Keystone Puppies to anyone searching for a dog!",5
keystonepuppies,I really enjoyed my experience with this company mostly for the feature that allows you to contact different breeders. I liked being able to connect with them and ask questions (I'm an experienced dog person) as well as learn a bit more about the puppy's lineage and personality. It was smooth to use the website as well.,5
keystonepuppies,"Our puppy, William, (Luka), is a very sweet and happy boy. Daniel Smucker, the breeder was friendly and informative. We got to meet William's Mom, and saw other dogs on the premises. Excellent experience, and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another puppy from him.",5
keystonepuppies,"My family and I had a wonderful experience with the breeder. He was very kind and respectful. He was very pleasant when I called to ask about Marshmallow. The breeder was willing to hold Marshmallow for us since we were traveling out of State to pick him up. When we arrived, we were very kindly greeted and even given some food for  Marshmallow since we are from out of State. Our Puppy is adjusting well thus far. Marshmallow has made a home a home again, but has brought so much joy during our time of loss. He has made a wonderful addition to our family.",5
keystonepuppies,"We've had ""Boo"" for almost 10 months.  She's been a great addition to the family from the start.  Virtually potty trained from the beginning.  Loveable.  Agreeable.  Trainable.  Alvin Stoltzfus and family were great to work with.",5
keystonepuppies,"I looked at different websites before I found a puppy named Hunter on Keystone Puppies, I called the breeder Elam and left a voice mail. He called me back the same day. He said yes, to our coming up the next day with our granddaughters to see Hunter. Elam is a very kind, caring and thoughtful person. He showed us where the puppies live with their parents. Everything was clean. The animals were well taken care of. Elam answered all our questions.  We were not rushed and were able to play with all 7 puppies. We all had a great experience. I would highly recommend  buying from Elam and Keystone Puppies.",5

keystonepuppies,"I recently purchased a Cavapoo puppy from Keystone Puppies and actually already left a review on here a few days after getting my pup. Initially I was very pleased with everything (the puppy seemed to be in good health, payment and everything was good, and the shipping went smoothly) but then I took my puppy to the vet and found out she had not been given her shots correctly and now I'm paying to have shots done that I supposedly already paid for in the price of the pup. So that was annoying. Other than that the puppy seems to be in good health (still waiting to hear back on a few other tests) and definitely isn't a scam, just be prepared to pay for shots that the pup is supposed to already have.",3
keystonepuppies,"After having our last Golden for 16 wonderful years you just get so used to a well behaved dog and somewhat dread starting over with a new puppy so full of energy. Our new puppy is a Godsend, he is so well behaved and so easily trained, sometimes I am amazed he is just a pup. While he has his puppy moments, he is so smart and well adjusted. He has so quickly adjusted to his new home and surroundings and has so quickly stolen our hearts,Thank You!",5
keystonepuppies,"Sam Blank and his wife (Linda?) breed beautiful puppies!  We got a female cockapoo, and she's the sweetest, most loving,  absolutely adorable puppy ever!The kennel was spotless and impeccably kept, the other animals were well conditioned and appeared to be just as interested in people.Mr. Blank called me several days after I picked up my puppy, just to make sure everything was going well and that we had taken her to the vet for a puppy check.  Her vaccines were up to date and appropriate for her age,  and she had no worms which is miraculous in itself!This is the third time I've used Keystone Puppies and I've been very happy with each one!",5
keystonepuppies,The experience was seamless and our puppy is the perfect fit for our family,5
keystonepuppies,"This was one of the best experiences I have had.   Cupcake is exactly what I was looking for.   The breeder asked questions about the personality of a dog I was looking for as well as activity level etc.  She suggested a few puppies.  I picked cupcake, she has been a treasure to me and my family.The only suggestion I can make is yo clearly have her house number posted at the street.",5
keystonepuppies,My experience with keystone puppies was great and most definitely will be using again if and when i’m looking for another furry friend. My breeder was more than a joy to work with and even helped me out with some issues i was having along side of trying to purchase our pup! i highly recommend this site as i was suspicious at first but it is more than amazing !,5

keystonepuppies,CHOCOLATE LAB PUPPY. The breeder followed up on any calls and we made an appointment to meet all the puppies and make my choice. My new puppy is healthy and is growing into a beautiful full size Chocolate Lab.

keystonepuppies,"Our little puppy has been sick since we purchased her.  The breeder has refunded the money for the cost of the puppy but the vet bills still exceed the cost of the puppy.  Hopefully, after she has surgery it will improve her well being.",3
keystonepuppies,"We got an English bulldog on 4/12/23. We couldn't be happier with him, he's healthy and such a sweetheart. The purchase of the dog went smoothly the woman we bought him from was very thorough and couldn't have been nicer. Great experience 😀",5
keystonepuppies,My experience was wonderful. I was able to find a puppy in my price range and pick her up quickly and the family I bought it from was very instructive on anything going on with our puppy I really suggest using keystone for purchasing a puppy. We bought a Cavapoo puppy and we love her,5
keystonepuppies,"We purchased a mini laberdoodle from a family in Lancaster. The woman's name was Liz, and she was so wonderful and just a gem to work with. She was very accommodating, and answered all of our questions. We felt very confident in the litter she had, and they all looked so healthy and well cared for. We were able to meet the Momma, and see their living area/conditions, etc. We ended up bringing a little male home with us; Chase, and it he is almost 6 mons. old and is as healthy as an ox, and is just beautiful all around! We could not of been happier with our little guy, and the experience we had with Liz!",5
keystonepuppies,"After getting swindled with a breeder I came across on the Internet, we lost $300. Thankfully we were able to get the money back through my bank, but very guarded in continuing to find a breeder for our new family puppy. Friend of mine mentioned Keystone puppies once I saw the beautiful litter of puppies that I was drawn to, I contacted the breeder Liz She was extremely quick to respond and very comforting with questions and flexibility for us to come visit with no obligations. We fell in love with one of the puppies, specifically, the one I really was drawn to from start to finish the transaction and information she provided was wonderful. Cannot say enough good things.

keystonepuppies,"It was very easy to find a puppy I liked. I found one that stood out to me as a part of our family. He was 2 hours away, but it didn't matter to me much because I was so excited to go meet him and bring him home. The site showed the location and number of the breeder that I was able to easily call and discuss a date to meet. He's had his shots up to date, dewormed, and has a health guarantee. He loves everyone and other dogs he meets outside too",5

keystonepuppies,"It was very easy to find my new puppy, though I have a lot of concern about puppy mills and bad breeders on this site. I hope you carefully vet each and every breeder to be sure the parents are not abused and over bred. If I had to do over again, I probably wouldn't use the internet. I will say, however, the breeder, Sam Blank, I came in contact with had an immaculate home and surroundings and the puppies seemed well cared for. I should have asked to meet the parents. And I was concerned that the breeder did not ask any questions about me, my family or the home the puppy was going to. No vet references were asked for. He seemed to be a nice person and easy to deal.with. But so many are just despicable. My puppy is doing great and had a positive vet check.",5

keystonepuppies,"I had the best experience with both my mini goldendoodle puppy's breeder, Mary Zook located in PA. I adopted Pooh whose name is now Luna and Piglet which Mary had renamed Princess and decided to keep her name, they now live with me in NC. Mary helped me know everything was secure and safe here on Keystone, at first I was suspicious since I had never adopted a pet online and wasn't going to first do a visit before adopting since it was just so far away from home. But Mary was super helpful and responded all my questions, told me about Pooh, and got me some videos of her so I could see her. My initial plan was to only adopt one puppy and ended up adopting two of them! It was the best decision, both sisters are now home with me, loving each other and have not had a hard time adjusting to their new home! I thank Mary for everything she did, since she knew I was coming from far away and I had a 9 hour drive she made sure to get the puppies tired and fed them so they could fall asleep on our way back to NC from PA. She also called to make sure we got home safe and that the puppies were good. Before leaving her place from picking up the puppies she asked me if I needed anything from her to make the ride more comfortable, she gave us food for each puppy and even pee pads, thank you so much Mary for all your help! I truly recommend anyone looking to adopt a mini goldendoodle to go with Mary Zook in PA.",5
keystonepuppies,SELLER was very friendly and had puppy ready at agreed upon time. Puppy was in excellent health. Seller provided small bag of food puppy was weaned on. Only problem was it came from a regional producer and I had to drive 75 miles to find a store that sold food.  We are totally pleased with this experience and adopted a great puppy.,5
keystonepuppies,"I purchased a Rottweiler back in December of 2020. He is 100% inbred and I dont care what anyone says, these are all puppy mills. He has bit me twice for no reason. He’s very well taken care of, spoiled rotten and I’m the one who takes care of him between my husband and I. I’ve spent $6,000 on training and nothing seems to help him. I’ve had Rottweilers my whole life, none like him. I love him to pieces but 1000000% inbred.",1
keystonepuppies,We purchased a 14 week old lab from a family in the Lancaster area. The puppies were living in a barn basically. It’s clear she’s had no socialization training.,2
keystonepuppies,The process was so easy! The seller was responsive and allowed us the time and space to visit with the puppies. Our new puppy is incredible and we couldn’t ask for anything more.,5
keystonepuppies,I recently got this amazing mini goldendoddle and he is truly the best. I am so grateful for him. His owners were so nice and took great care of him! I was so glad they kept him on hold for me!,5
keystonepuppies,"Awesome dealing with Chester, he and his wife were helpful and responsible breeders. Simple pick up and review of the dogs vaccines and paper work.",5
keystonepuppies,Breeder was quick to respond and answered any and all questions. Puppy is in excellent health. Was nicely socialized for a family. She already is a wonderful addition to our family.,5

keystonepuppies,I can’t say enough about working with Mr. Smucker. He was willing to hold her for us (even though he didn’t have to) knowing we were driving several hours to see and get “Maxi.” Now named Fayra. He sent food home so we could wean her off so it would be easier for her. All of the veterinarian and vaccine paperwork was well organized and our veterinarian had all the information she needed. Mr. Smucker even called to check in a couple of times to make sure the transition to her new home was going well. Fayra is smart and has a very good temperament. I would not hesitate to work with Mr. Smucker or to refer friends in the future. Thank you!,5
keystonepuppies,We had a lots of communication with the breeder and at the time of picking up my puppy the breeder was very helpful and give us good advice. The place was very clean and my puppy very healthy. Thank you Ruthie.,5

keystonepuppies,"I was admittedly a bit concerned about buying a puppy in Lancaster, PA given the issues there with puppy mills and nefarious breeders claiming to be Amish. Keystone is a service intermediary of sorts between breeder and a pup's furever home - providing marketing and guidance for breeders and search and support services for potential owners. As happens with employment agencies and other liaison-service providers, I imagine a less than stellar breeder slips through the cracks now and then. As far as I can tell, however, Keystone does everything possible to ensure this doesn't happen.Personally, our experience could not have possibly been any better, The Amish couple we purchased our Goldador from were incredibly kind and accommodating. We were able to meet both parents on site and see where the puppies were raised. They only have two or three litters of puppies per year with obviously loved (and a little too well fed) family dogs. They were clearly honest, good folk and were so very patient with us as we went back and forth trying to decide which puppy we wanted. Kylo Rey just turned four months. He is an absolute delight and in perfect health. We've had no issues whatsoever. The wife even called TWICE to check and see how our little love bundle was doing.I think Keystone is offering a valuable service and doing a good job minimizing the issues that can arise around puppy breeding. We drove over 8 hours to get our pup and would absolutely trust and use their services again. In fact, we have recommended several people looking for a particular breed to consider Keystone.",5
keystonepuppies,To begin with our puppy is healthy and has been since we picked her up.  Second but very important was that the breeders we very kind and responsive.   You could tell the puppies we're well loved and taken care of.,5
keystonepuppies,"Such a fantastic experience.  I wasn't sure which puppy I wanted, as I had fallen in love with so many of these cute little faces.  Once I decided I learned my chosen Yorkiepoo had been spoken for.  Sadie Herschberger was the breeder and she couldn't have been any kinder and compassionate.  She took my name and number and said she would call me if there was any change.  She told me not to get my hopes up but would call, should the other family decide not to adopt Porkchop.  Several days later, Sadie called me and informed me that Porkchop was now available.  My heart sank and I cried.  I immediately hopped in my car and drove 3 hours to pick up my little guy.    Sadie had all of his paperwork ready to go along with a bag of food and a collar for my pup to take him home.  A huge shoutout to Sadie who couldn't have been sweeter and so fabulous to work with.Porkchop is the perfect addition to my home!  I have modified his name, slightly as he is now known as Sir Porkchop.I highly recommend Sadie Herschberger and will recommend anyone who is looking for a yorkiepoo to her.  I may go back for another!",5

keystonepuppies,"I just bought a puppy through them. Mind you, they are just a platform for breeders to list their puppies. However they do verify the condition of each puppy listed.The puppy I looked at had this video along with pictures of if the puppy:I called the breeder, asked a few questions. He offered to put a microchip in as well. He got back to me with the shipping price and day of arrival.The person that handled the shipping for the breeder, contacted me and asked if it would be alright to send the puppy to Miami instead of Fort Lauderdale as it wasn’t a direct flight to Fort Lauderdale and she was concerned for the puppy to be in transit so long. I asked for West Palm Beach airport instead and she accommodated that.The breeder attached all paperwork, (vaccinations etc and a one year genetic guarantee) along with a bag of food to last for several days and a bottle of purified water.The puppy is exactly as playful as shown in the video. Today we took it to the veterinarian and all is well. We have a healthy cute little puppy.The breeder was Amish too. They seem to have a bad rap for being puppy mill breeders but this just wasn’t my experience. I read another review online where the breeder I bought from was positively mentioned and that person actual went and picked up the puppy (in Pennsylvania) and saw the condition of the place and mentioned the cleanliness.So from my actual experience with Keystone Puppies, they do not sell puppy mill puppies.",5
keystonepuppies,Breeder was amazing. Very friendly and helpful. Our pup is absolutely fantastic. Couldn’t ask for a better dog.,5

keystonepuppies,"Omar and Shanna couldn’t have been more friendly. I spoke to Omar on the phone and I was smiling before he even finished saying hello. We met Shanna and kids when we went to see Jasmine. Shanna was very sweet and very helpful and the kids were so polite. Their little farm is in a beautiful area and is as clean as anyone could hope for. Absolutely pristine. Jasmine was the last pup left from her litter, but we had already fallen in love with her sweet face. She was friendly and very much a puppy!  We have had her for about a month and changed her name at least 4 times in the first few days to find the name that truly fit her. Daisy, Molly, and Roxie, were all tried and discarded. But then came Gracie. It completely fits her. She is sweet, a big cuddler, and very smart. Shanna gave us more than enough food to transition her to our dog food. She gets along well with our other 2 dogs and we can’t imagine not having her. The communication with Omar and Shanna, both before and after the purchase when we had a question was very quick and helpful. It was smooth and pleasant!",5

The puppies dad was at a different place then the mom and puppies and when we asked to see the dad Daniel contacted the other owner and we were able to go there and see the dad first.

keystonepuppies,"Hi my name is Sunni I adopted my puppy Duffy now named Savanna last August 2023. My experience was  awesome. My husband and I were very skeptical about buying a puppy online only because the news was saying there were scams about getting puppies online. Rest assured keystone puppies are a legitimate business. The breeder was so nice and informative. He actually held her for me until we got back from vacation. Savanna is healthy, smart and so sweet. I highly recommend getting a puppy from keystone puppies.",5

keystonepuppies,"There are not enough words I can express about Sadie.  I recently lost my Yorkipoo Gizmo who gave me un-conditional love for 15 plus years, it was a traumatic experience, and I was not sure I wanted to get another dog.  I did search the web for Yorkipoo's and thoroughly investigated the organizations via BBB and read all the reviews prior to looking at the available puppies.  When I went into Keystone, I suddenly saw Peanut whose eyes and features looked exactly like Gizmo.  I immediately contacted Sadie, the Breeder, to confirm availability.  I was immediately impressed with her sympathy for my loss, but mostly the questions she asked me about my background, how many people who resided in my home, the type of home I resided in etc.  She was more concerned with who she was selling Peanut to, instead of the sale.  In addition, to answering all the question I had about Peanut.  Once the sale was confirmed, Shawn took over with shipping Peanut to my home since I lived in RI.  He was great, I was emailing him quite often with questions I had about shipping.  He answered all questions and got back to me in a timely manner.  The shipping was seamless, he emailed me at every stage of the shipping process even though I was also tracking Peanut.  I do not hesitate to highly recommend Sadie Herschberger as a Breeder and Shawn at Keystone Puppies if shipping is necessary.  If there is a 5 or 10 star rating, they have both.",5

He quickly adapted to my schedule and I make sure to take him to various public areas to expose him to new people and surroundings, which he handles with ease. Chico Blake is a delightful and energetic pup who is both intelligent and obedient. Although he can be a little reserved in outdoor environments, he is playful and affectionate at home. I am grateful to Ruth for bringing such a loving and well-mannered puppy into my life.",5
keystonepuppies,"The owner, Leon Esch was very helpful with answering my questions. He provided instructions to his home address so we can pick up Cooper who is now known as Mylo.

I would recommend to anyone who is looking to adopt a dog.",5

keystonepuppies,"After contacting several breeders in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia I felt that I got the kind of response I was looking for from Keystone Puppies. Our breeder in particular, Emmanuel was very cooperative. Unlike other breeders I contacted Emmanuel allowed us to see our pup before making a final decision and making a commitment to the actual purchase. Seeing Mable, we have since renamed her Sophie we could not have been more pleased. Since bring Sophie just has had two vets to our vet. Our vet felt she was a very healthy pup, which of course made us even more pleased with our pup. It is worth noting that every one who has seen Sophie just loves her. I know for sure that a friend having seen Sophie and heard of out experience has since made a purchase of a cavapoo from Keystone Puppies.",5

He is bright and has learned several commands.  His trip to the vet one week after we got him went well, he is in good health. The second vet appt. confirmed the above and he is gaining weight, as expected. Abner Stoltzfus was very friendly and knowledgeable regarding our puppy.  He even called us a day or two after we got him to see how Gizmo was doing and how is was getting along with his new family.  Very happy all the way around, we would strongly recommend Keystone Puppies to anyone looking for a new puppy.",5

keystonepuppies,Our only disappointment with purchasing from your breeder was the papers we were given stated his stool was not tested. When we brought him home we noticed he was not able to go to the bathroom resulting in us having to promptly take him to the vet. Unfortunately this resulted in him having a parasite and going on medication which was quite costly. He is doing fine now and we are enjoying him a lot!,3
keystonepuppies,I got my puppy from Ruth and now he is the love of my life!! I named him Chico Blake. He is a well mannered puppy with good temperament.

He is also smart and understands my commands. Outside he can be a little shy but at home he is very playful.,5

He came with his shots a bag of food and a guarantee from any breed abnormalities. My fur baby is so loveable and friendly. Best thing I ever did #🥰🐶mom,5
keystonepuppies,"I love the fact I pulled up the breed we wanted and she was the first picture I saw.  Keystone has many selections of any type of breed you desire. What really impressed me was that you deal with Breeder directly.  We wanted a Cavalier King Charles female and I wanted to name her ""Angel"".  I was shocked to see the first picture came up a gorgeous Cavalier and her name was ""Angel""!  She's a happy, healthy, gorgeous pup that is so affectionate.   She stole my heart immediately and I have Keystonepuppies and Jacob Huyard, the Breeder, to thank for it!",5

Lydiann informed me of how the puppy’s current temperament was, and how she likes to play and what she likes to do. She explained how well she is doing with potty training, and how she currently feeds. While we were filling out the necessary paperwork, I could tell how much James adored his dogs and the puppy. Very loving! My puppy is doing very well currently and I incorporated her name (Lynn) from her previous home into mine. Her name is now Marilynn and she has been a wonderful addition to our family. She is very loving and cuddly little girl. If I had to do it all over again, I would do so, without hesitation. Thank you again James and Lydiann Lapp!",5

keystonepuppies,"Everything went well from start to finish.  The site is great as you can look at a variety of different breeds of dogs and the various costs associated with them. The breeder we dealt with was very nice and I would send friends to deal with them.  The cost of buying our dog, including the shipping cost, was almost half of what it would have cost down here in Florida. I have already given this site's name to a few of our friends.  Shawn was also great to work with, as he kept me appraised of the flight situation and all that it entailed.",5

keystonepuppies,"I got Diana Brisket (formerly Brisk) from Ephraim Stoltzfus and I absolutely love her. She drives me crazy at times being sassy as ever, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.

keystonepuppies,Dogs were well taken care of. The sellers showed us the parents and the kennels. You could tell they really cared about their dogs and puppies!

keystonepuppies,"My experience has been terrible with merv the breeze of my cane Corso, nothing was as it seemed. I drove over 2 hours from West Virginia to coatsville pa , when I arrived I realize the breeder was jus a guy that had some pups outside in a cage not at all how it was described on the site. Went got Zeus any way cause I had already grew to love him soon as I got him home noticed he had a cough took him to the vet he had kennel cough, I did what the brochure said I texted him immediately still believing this site was reputable and he never responded after we had been talking for days, so I took a pic of the 438 dollar bill still nothing, now I jus came back from the vet my baby boy now has cherry eye gonna cost another 800-1000 I love him so I’m stuck now so I think this website is fraudulent and bogus they say they visit these people and I really think it’s bs. I wouldn’t trade my boy for another but will never visit this site or refer anyone ever again, Thanks keystone puppies what a joke",1

We were going to wait until we returned home in Florida before looking for another mini Doxie. My husband happened to be looking through the internet. I wanted a mini red female Doxie. He found the perfect puppy through your company. The price was a bit less, maybe she was the runt. We didn’t care. So we drove to Pennsylvania and the second we saw her, we knew she was what our broken hearts needed. It was very easy to work with the lady we got her from. I would have liked to see the parents of our puppy. And I would like to have the lineage done for several generations. Not sure how to do that. I’m on the lookout for a black and tan male mini Doxie as a playmate for our baby girl. Anyway, we are so far very happy with our puppy and the nice folks who sold her to us.

keystonepuppies,"My experience is not so much about Keystone Puppies but our experience with the breeder. Once I found a puppy and contacted Mr. Glick, he answered all my questions about the puppy. We were very impressed with Mr. Glick's home and family. When we went to get the puppy, Mr. Glick went over all the shots and health checks. I was impressed with the lineage of the puppy and that the pup was microchipped. Mr. Glick sent home a care package for the puppy that had food, treats and a piece of material with the mother's scent. The puppy is a wonderful little guy. He is healthy and playful and has already given us more joy than we could ever have imagined. Thank you to Keystone Puppies, I would definitely recommend to others because your guidelines are keeping adult dogs and their puppies safe and loved and treated with humanity. So much can go wrong when you are looking for a puppy but this was a great experience.",5

keystonepuppies,Keystone Puppies is wonderful! The website is kept up to date and the information is correct. Their breeders are certified non-puppy mill which was very important to us. We are very happy with Keystone Puppies!We were so impressed by the breeder's (Chester Stolfutz) care and knowledge about the puppies. He encouraged up to spend as much time as we wanted playing with the puppies before we made our choice. He crushed up a large bag of puppy kibble for us and also a new bag of food. He followed up later by phone to see how the puppy was doing and if we had any questions. The vet confirmed that the puppy was very healthy and had no issues.,5
keystonepuppies,"Linda Smucker was so kind and I was so happy to adopt Ariel, now known as Sasha.",5
keystonepuppies,The breeder had great communication and made the process very easy. I would recommend keystone to anyone looking for a puppy.,5
keystonepuppies,This was a super easy process. Very efficient. I love my Stella more than anything. She is a healthy and happy puppy. My only complaint is that I was told her parents weighed 12 and 16 lbs. I find that difficult to believe as Stella weighs in at 11 lbs at 4 months. My vet says she is not at all overweight. She is going to be significantly larger than I expected.  At this point it is what it is. I wouldn’t give her up for anything.,4
keystonepuppies,"Our breeder who were the sweetest family. They answered any of her questions, they give us food to take home so we could ween our puppy off without upsetting his stomach. And honestly I would’ve taken another puppy but our mother said no. Because he is the sweetest most loving puppy this was a wonderful experience.",5

keystonepuppies,"I'm so glad I chose Keystone Puppies to find my next labrador puppy. I could not have had a better experience!!! I got my puppy from Wilmer and Betty King in Morgantown, PA. They were open and honest about everything. I actually ended up getting a different puppy than the one I went to get. The puppy I got is perfect! Perfect health, energy and disposition. They brought out multiple puppies they had available. They gave me plenty of time to spend with them so I could choose the right one. Each puppy they had was perfect. Seeing all the ones they brought out made it hard. They're just so darn cute!!! I chose the puppy I did because she wouldn't let me stop giving her attention. I knew she was the one. I'm so thankful to Wilmer and Betty for the perfect puppy I got from them. I will definitely keep them in mind if I get another puppy. I highly recommend Keystone Puppies and Wilmer and Betty King not just because of the experience, but because they guarantee no puppy mills. Which was very important to me making my choice of where to get a puppy.",5
keystonepuppies,"I’m enjoying our puppy, realizing how sweet she is!  The breeder, Chris King, was great to tell me about her prior to my decision to purchase her.  I had a huge number of questions for him which he handled well.

Chris’ pups are perfect!  Thanks, Chris!",5

keystonepuppies,The Labrador Retriever we purchased appeared healthy but had a rash on her stomach. Our veterinarian determined it was ringworm and she also had an ear infection and tested positive for roundworm. The ongoing treatment has been very expensive. This was not a good experience.,1
keystonepuppies,Got a gorgeous Labradoodle from Pa. The seller was extremely nice and helpful. The pup has settles in and is a joy to have.,5
keystonepuppies,"Overall experience was great the puppy is amazing and we’re enjoying him as he grows. The breeder was amazing to communicate with and was very helpful.The only comment is that the puppy had fleas when we got him, but looks like it’s a common thing.",4
keystonepuppies,"When we went to ""look"" at puppies for the first time after saying goodbye to our dog of 17 years, the puppies we met were so sweet, we ended up with two!!These Havapoo puppies are the sweetest, most mild temperate, loving puppies that we have ever met.

Worth the trip!",5
keystonepuppies,"I received a most positive prompt reply from my breeder.  He was most forthcoming and helpful.  We made arrangements to visit that same day, and later that afternoon I greeted my new puppy to my family.I was very comfortable and appreciative with the breeder, and he most helpful in discussing all the puppies.",5

keystonepuppies,Jazz has adapted to her surroundings in a new state. We are so excited she is now part of the family. She has been a great puppy so far.,5
keystonepuppies,The puppy was 4 1/2 months old and was not sociable at all. When it’s kept in the garage to sleep and out in the field all day it’s very hard for a dog to all of a sudden be around other people. We actually ended up returning the dog to the owner,1
keystonepuppies,"The breeder was very responsive and friendly, and it was a nice experience going to meet the puppies. My new girl is sweet and loving and smart and healthy, everything I could want in a puppy. Overall this was a great experience.",5

Puppy known as lady now is such a sweetheart, I can definitely tell she got to play with her liter mates in grass a lot because she can’t get enough of it. She’s very good with kids and I would definitely love to get another puppy from them!",5
keystonepuppies,Keystone puppies is a puppy mill.they severly abuse the dogs. When i picked up my goldendoodle sunny she was bleeding and got kicked by the breeder. Sunny was also covered in feces. I will never buy from elmer fisher again.,1
keystonepuppies,Love my pup thanks you guys are the best!,5
keystonepuppies,Very good experience. Breeder was nice but not much info was given regarding the puppies food. However we did receive a ziplock with his food so it was easy to get him transition. Also my vet did not accepted the vaccine list because it wasn’t signed by the vet giving them.,4
keystonepuppies,Wonderful and easy to work with!  The whole family has fallen in love with the beautiful puppy.  Thank you,5
keystonepuppies,The breeder was excellent. The mom and puppies were well taken care of. It was refreshing.,5
keystonepuppies,"Elam was so great, and he's kept in touch with us to talk through puppy-raising issues since the adoption. Our puppy is a happy, healthy little chaos muppet. We're so glad he has come into our lives!",5
keystonepuppies,"All 3 puppies had worms upon initial vet visits days after picking them up at the breeder. Otherwise, everything is good with puppies. They are adjusting to life in our families.",4
keystonepuppies,"This is an A+ scam for Amish and/or Mennonite breeders in Lancaster, PA. Mixed breed dogs as purebreds, horrible conditions (dogs living in small pens, etc.), no proper vaccines (confirmed by my vet after blood tests) and so much more.If you buy a dog from one of these ""breeders,"" make sure you take them right away to the vet for fleas/ticks and dewormer.They advertise as ""raised with children."" Yes the dog is in the pen, and the children are around the house a hundred or so feet away.Do not believe any of the advertising on the website. You are dealing with breeders who are culturally different than the rest of us. They view dogs simply as livestock to be sold. When I asked the breeder, ""what did you do with the feces?"" Answer: ""Oh I just shoveled hay on top of it."" Please keep in mind this is a dog who lived in a pen (4 x 2.5 approx.) and never came out for anything; not to potty or run around.The reality is, when you arrive, you will feel so bad for that dog you will take it anyway just to save it from these people. The dog didn't know how to walk. It was simply terrified of everything, especially the breeder's children. I couldn't leave the dog there in good conscience.Shame on you, the management of this advertising site. Shame on you, the breeder, Amos Esh. You're more of an animal than these poor dogs.",1
keystonepuppies,The experience was very easy. The breeder was great and my family loves our Cavachon!,5
keystonepuppies,"Love our little puppy!! We drove to pick up our little guy, he was healthy and happy. The people we purchased our dog from was nice, all shots were up to date and all questions were answered. They even gave us food to take home. Overall a wonderful experience!

keystonepuppies,Breeder was great to work with. Very responsive with communication and very easy to work with. We love our new puppy and had a great overall experience.,5
keystonepuppies,One year genetic health guarantee for the cost of this puppy seems insignificant considering the pain and suffering my puppy has to endure living with this genetic deformities for profit!  Shame on you keystone puppies and Daniel Stolzafoos!!,1
keystonepuppies,"Breeder Sam Blank Christiana, PAWe found our adorable cavapoo puppy through Keystone puppies, where breeder Sam Blank advertises.Once we expressed interest through the site, we were connected directly with Sam.  We talked a few times on the phone, but mostly through text. I personally put a lot of faith in the process because there wasn't anything that kept us posted on the status of the puppy unless I texted Sam or called him and asked for updates / more pictures.  It would have been nice to have a system where you can track progress/status.  Other than that, Sam was super kind, supportive and really worked with us to make sure we were able to buy a puppy from him.  We waited months!  Finally when the time came to pick up, it was fast and easy. We weren't able to meet Sam, but my husband met his wife and all questions were answered.   The puppy was happy and healthy and is currently thriving. We are one of the most happiest families in So. Florida!  Thank you Sam for making our Cavapoo puppy dreams come true!!",5
keystonepuppies,The process from beginning to end was easy.  The breeder Alvin Stolfzus and his family were very receptive and kind.  The let us take our time with the puppies to make a decision.  The puppies are all socialized with their children.  Their home was pristine and very clean.  Everything was well taken care of.  The puppies were clean and happy.  Our Hannah is 3 months old and she has adjusted perfectly.  She has a great temperament and gets along with other dogs well.  Sweet and easy going. Thank you Alvin and Keystone Puppies.  We’re very happy with our new addition to our family.,5

keystonepuppies,I had a great experience with keystone puppies! I love their 1 year health guarantee. The breeders I contacted through keystone were all extremely friendly and accommodating. The toy poodle I brought home is healthy and happy and I couldn’t be happier myself!,5
keystonepuppies,You guys should do a little bit better checks on your breeders I purchased a puppy from Mr. stoltzfus took the puppy to the vet come to find out he had severe ear infections he was missing parts of his ears that were scared up due to flies eat and them and ear mites i was reimbursed,1
keystonepuppies,"So in love with our mini bernedoodle!We were nervous as can be about shipping our sweet boy for a few hours on a flight, but he arrived safe, and healthy! I felt good knowing he was being tracked by Keystone.Took him to the vet 2 weeks after having him and he's healthy as can be!He was our missing piece, and our experience with both our breeder, Henry Fisher, and shipping with Sean at Keystone exceeded our expectations!I would buy a second pup from keystone if I had the energy to keep up with another LOL",5
keystonepuppies,"It was a good experience, this is the first time we get a puppy from keystone puppies, The plan was to get the puppy for my daughter‘s birthday so I sent the payment overnight, cost me a lot of money and I payed for shipping as well, by doing that I was told that they’ll send the puppy right away, unfortunately it didn’t work that way. The reason was that the temperatures were too high on the plane and they also didn’t have the right paperwork from the vet, so finally we received our puppy about a month later.The good thing is that they kept informing me about everything, if it was for the safety of the puppy I’m OK with that. But I highly recommend keystone puppies, they are great.",4
keystonepuppies,"I love how easy it was to use in finding my fur baby on this website. The shipper was very nice and they took care of all the arrangements and kept us updated on any lay over with the flight. Everything went smoothly. The breeder was very nice and easy to talk to. In fact, we made a new friendship and I’m keeping in touch with updated photos and new milestones. I LOVE my new furever Baby. Thank you!",5
keystonepuppies,"They make the whole process seamless, easy, and transparent.",5
keystonepuppies,We've now used Keystone Puppies for a 2nd time in appx 5 years. They once again hit it out of the park for us with terrific fast response and communication through to the safe delivery of our new healthy puppy. They are very highly recommended and trusted!,5
keystonepuppies,It was very easy to search through all the puppies that were available at the time we were looking. The issue I have is not so much with the site itself but with the information that was given for the puppy we bought. She has showed aggressive behavior to our other dog and at times with us. We were told her breed was a good family dog and gets along well with other dogs. We have been able to work with her on these aggressive behaviors but she still shows them almost daily.,3
keystonepuppies,Beyond amazed!,5
keystonepuppies,I really loved my entire experience. The puppy checked out 100 percent healthy and any questions that I had were answered right away.,5
keystonepuppies,"Had a tremendous experience with the breeders. They were quite accommodating to our needs and we were blessed to receive a wonderful, wonderful puppy that we love and adore.

keystonepuppies,"I was very pleased with the experience of getting Noah (this is how I named him). The breeder was very helpful, kind and honest. He send me the videos of the dog in motion that I requested and when I arrived to see the puppy it was just like he said. He informed us well about the dog and his health. Noah is a great dog and we are so happy to have him in our family.",5
keystonepuppies,Excellent experIence! I highly recommend! 10/10 A+,5
keystonepuppies,We are totally happy with the experience we had getting our puppy,5
keystonepuppies,The website is ok. A good place to look for a dog. My advice is to do as much research as possible on any breed you are considering purchasing. I think the site should make it mandatory the breeder upload all medical conditions. It’s not a guarantee the breeder will be forthcoming with all medical issues with the dog!! Always be cautious of lower priced dogs!!! Something is wrong with them!!!,2
keystonepuppies,"At first I was a little skeptical adopting my puppy through Keystones, mostly because I had never heard of it before. But the breeder that I got my puppy from was very kind and they had someone hand deliver him to me, which was very kind of them and a lot cheaper than sending him on a plane. They also sent him with food so that I could gradually change his diet.",5
keystonepuppies,No review text found,5
keystonepuppies,Extremely nice family to deal with! They were very helpful with the whole puppy purchase experience! We love our new little addition to our family! Cole (Rolo) is so playful and loves his new forever home!!,5
keystonepuppies,Seller easy to communicate and deal with. He provided all necessary paperwork and we were able to see where they were kept and raised. He even provided some food to take home as well as all paperwork with all info we needed for the Vet. Would def recommend!!!!,5
keystonepuppies,"We were not expecting to meet an Amish family while picking up our new member of the family. BUT MAN DID THEY DELIVER. Super kind and friendly folks out at Stony Curve Farm. All the puppies were kept in a very clean and orderly pen in their cow barn. ALL of the puppies looked healthy, and happy with literally the best temperaments, playful, and sweet. Ben was nothing short of helpful and knowledgeable. Absolutely excellent experience all around. IF YOU WANT A GOLDADOR THESE ARE YOUR PEOPLE!!!",5
keystonepuppies,"She is beautiful,  we had to take her to the vet twice due to having parasites.  She has to be checked at the end of July.  Prayers all is well.",5
keystonepuppies,I am thrilled with our new puppies -- thanks!,5
keystonepuppies,"Puppy arrived as promised. However, she seemed to have been overly sedated. We did not realize that she was deaf. So, the trip was most likely more stressful for her. She is now happy and healthy.",5
keystonepuppies,Wonderful I would recommend this place always,5
keystonepuppies,Adorable mini goldendoodle great experience!  Vet checked!,5
keystonepuppies,We purchased Floyd from Mel and could not be happier!! It was seriously the easiest transaction ever. We emailed back and forth on a Sunday & Monday and Floyd was at our door by Tuesday evening!! He has such a great temperament! Thanks Mel,5
keystonepuppies,Pick up puppy in Pennsylvania from a gentleman named Jacob was very helpful and looking forward to doing future business with Jacob. Thank you to the website that directed me to Jacob. Jacob called the puppy Rose we call her Rosie and that's how Rosie  got her name.,5
keystonepuppies,Well my experience with keystones puppies at first I was very skeptical if the website was real. I contacted many breeders trying to find the one puppy I wanted which was a mini Goldendoodle. I was from New Jersey so I didn’t want to get scammed and drive all the way to Pennsylvania. I found this Beauty puppy named wishes and decided she was the one I wanted. I traveled the same day for about a 3 hour drive. I meet the breeder and the two puppies he had. The only thing was that she only had a couple shots but was almost 3 months so I had to waste more money than it said on the website. I guess they don’t keep them up to date. It was a wonder experience and meeting your puppy would be wonderful.,5
keystonepuppies,"My wife and I had a dog just pass away. It was very unexpected. When I saw a toy poodle on the website, (our dog was an older toy poodle, my wife's mother asked us to take care of it before she passed), I couldn't resist.We drove 3 and 1/2 hours to look at this dog and brought it back with us. The breeder, Steve, and his family was so nice and helpful, it was great. This pup slept in my arms the whole trip, never complained, is nearly house broken, smart, loving and playful. Yes, she is a pup and will still get into things, but I would highly recommend not only Keystone Puppies, but Steve in Nottingham as well. Thank you.",5
keystonepuppies,I love my dog. She checked out healthy and happy!!!,5
keystonepuppies,Very friendly. Puppies were good taken care of.Exactly like the picture. Would recommend!!,5

keystonepuppies,"I was hesitant to buy a puppy from Keystone, fearing puppy mills. This breeder couldn’t be further from a puppy mill. They had dogs everywhere! I bought the last lhasapoo from Jake and Ann Speicher. My puppy was and is happy, healthy, playful, and loving! Easy to pee pad train. Good experience. BTW, Jake and Ann also breed beautiful Chihuahuas!",5
keystonepuppies,We are very pleased with the health and cleanliness of the new puppy.  The children just love him.  I have been recommending this breeder to others.,5

keystonepuppies,"Not an AKC but we didn't care anyway.  She is the seetest, smartist little puppy we've ever had and we're over 70 years old.  Trains well, knows where she is allowed to go and not to.  She is excellent with new 'friends' whether it's people or animals.  Not sure yet how she'll do going out in the  snow, but we'll figure that out when we come to it.",5
keystonepuppies,Everything was great.Love her so much.and she is doing great,5

keystonepuppies,"Keystone Puppies made it so easy for us to find the puppy of our dreams.  We worked with a well-vetted, trusted breeder and ended up bringing home a beautiful, well-adjusted 3 month old Mini Golden-Doodle.  We couldn’t be happier with the service Keystone Puppies provides, and would highly recommend them for anyone looking to avoid the scammers out there!  Thank you Keystone Puppies!",5
keystonepuppies,I was a little nervous getting our puppy shipped by plane and not being able to see him in person beforehand. The breeder and the shipper we contacted through Keystone Puppies answered all our questions and we even got a pic of our little guy before he was shipped by plane. Both parties followed up to make sure our pup was delivered safe and sound and that he was doing well.,5
keystonepuppies,Very easy to work with! Helpful during the transfer. Even sent some food home with us,5
keystonepuppies,Had an amazing experience. Know that all breeders are not the same. This site is basically a third party. You’re not getting your newest member from keystone. They have tons of breeders.  I found a Breeder the king family to be exact. They were amazing with their communication. We paid our deposit and went to pick up our golden doodle. They gave us e nice size bag of food and taught us how to care for him. Amazing experience,5
keystonepuppies,"We were very pleased with our whole experience. Ruth Ann is a  wonderful person to work with and our puppy is very well adjusted and healthy.  This is a great family to deal with if you have the opportunity to connect with the Fisher family in Parksburg, PA  when they have puppies.  Highly recommended.",5
keystonepuppies,"We love our new Golden Retriever puppy. The adoption was easy.  The Breeder responded to all my questions. There was an additional fee for vet checkup, which didn't seem unreasonable. Once I submitted payment through paypal, I was able to make flight arrangements and receive her from a nearby airport. Part of the fee for transportation included a dog crate, which was helpful.  Our puppy seemed a little traumatized by the travel and unfamiliar surroundings (which was to be expected), but we were prepared with cleaning supplies, pet supplies and treats to help the situation.One item we forgot was a collar which we wished we had because we want to let her walk around for a while before bringing her home. All said, it was a positive experience. I would recommend Keystone puppies.",5
keystonepuppies,Very easy to use website.  Found the exact puppy we were looking for.,5

keystonepuppies,"Steve & Arline were wonderful to work with! They answered ALL my questions (and I had a lot) & were great about promptly returning phone calls. They arranged shipment of Coda (now named Roma) to us in a different state and kept us informed every step of the way. A few days after we received Roma, Arlene called to make sure she was adjusting well with our other dog & to make sure our vet appointment went well. I can’t say enough good things about our experience. I would definitely purchase from them again!",5
keystonepuppies,Super easy and nice people! We picked up our puppy about 2 months ago and it was an extremely easy process and really easy and open communication.

keystonepuppies,"I found my fur baby, Tank, a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, from Keystone Puppies -and it's one of the best things that has ever happened to me! The breeders were very kind, honest, and helpful, but as a general rule, please be sure to research into the breeders you are buying from. There is screening for the breeders, but it is difficult to discern just how much screening goes into the process. I will say though, I am beyond happy that I came across Keystone Puppies because if I hadn't, I wouldn't have my amazing Tank!",5
keystonepuppies,The process was nice and easy the people that we dealt with were very good and the puppy is a handful but a joy,5

keystonepuppies,"I had agreed to purchase Hollywood on website.  I asked owner for another photo of the dog I chose and she informed me they don’t have ability to send pictures on phone.   I had to go in their word that I was getting the dog in photo.  I confirmed day before I was coming.  I drove 6 hours to address.  About 20 minutes before arriving, I called the owner to tell them I was close and couldn’t wait to see Hollywood.  On the phone she told me I was getting Huckleberry.  Hollywood was sold.  I was shocked and completely uncomfortable thinking this was a scam.  I decided to go anyway with intention to not take dog if it was not same breed.The puppy I got was very sweet and we love him to pieces!  The only difference was Hollywoods nose was pure black and Huckleberry’s has a bit of red.  Very minimal difference.  The same breed.I am so happy to have Aero now.

He answered all of the questions we had and followed up a few days later.The experience with Keystone Puppies was fantastic easy and secure.",5
keystonepuppies,I was not impressed with this breeder. The puppy had hook and round worms and an ear yeast infection. He also had a eye kash disorder that still may require a 600.00 surgery to fix which he was forthcoming about but only knocked 90.00 off the price of the puppy. I would not recommend buying a puppy from him. However we are very happy with the puppy. He is awesome.,3

keystonepuppies,It’s been 2 weeks since we brought our puppy home an we are truly in love with her.The facility was clean and the puppies were very well tended to. I highly recommend!,5
keystonepuppies,"I was able to find our puppy using Keystone Puppies very easily. The website was very helpful and one of the reasons I used it was because it guaranteed no puppy mill puppies. However, when we went to get our puppy, we found that we were in Lancaster, on a farm, and neither parent dog was around to view and there were apparently some siblings from the litter around but we were not able to meet them either, which was a red flag. However, I was not going to leave our dog behind at that location because it was clearly a puppy mill - which we later confirmed with a state trooper in the area. I am disappointed that Keystone Puppies did not do their due diligence when vetting the people selling puppies on their site. They should really do better, especially when the seller is in Lancaster, PA - a huge puppy mill area. The individual was nice enough that we got our puppy from, but the vet records were very questionable. Thankfully, our puppy is healthy and thriving and we love her to bits. But, buyer beware - while Keystone Puppies ""guarantees"" no puppy mill pups, they do not actually vet the sellers.",3

keystonepuppies,"I contacted our pups owners and received a super quick response.  Dave and Emma were wonderful to deal with.  Originally I was interested in adopting a puppy after we lost our beloved Yorkie, Samantha.  Once I saw the little girls that were available to adopt, I ended up leaving with two! They have brought such joy and laughter to our lives.  They are healthy, happy and sweet as can be.  It's been difficult to get an appointment with our vet because of the back log due to Covid so their first visit is tomorrow and I'm expecting all to go well.  I'm forever grateful to Dave and Emma for making these little girls available to us.  Our broken heart over the loss of our Samantha has healed a bit with all the smiles and happiness the pups provide every day.  My husband calls them our two little bunnies.

keystonepuppies,"The breeder (Levi Glick) was professional and followed up after the sale. At the beginning he asked a lot of questions regarding the home the puppy was going to integrate into and our history with pets. When we visited the puppy we immediately saw how well socialized she was with the family and other puppies. Once we picked up our toy poodle he provided a very comprehensive welcome package that included about two months of food the puppy had been fed, the shot history and vet certification of health, locator chip registration material as well as other AKC back ground info on the puppies lineage. When he followed up after a week, he wanted to be sure the puppy was doing well and if there were any issues. He called again the following week to be sure we had no issues registering the locator chip.Without a doubt this breeder was making sure the puppy was loved and in a home that would care for her and she would be happy.  We are blessed to have found such a caring and compassionate person to purchase our new family member from. Thank you Levi!!!!",5

Levi and his family were all so kind, attentive and so educated with providing us all the information regarding the puppies health, vaccines, AKC information, and went as far as giving the puppy a security blanket for the puppy, food and treats for the road trip back home.  Such an honor to deal with good and genuine people like Levi. I will definitely be buying another puppy in the future from him. Thank you and God bless you!",5

keystonepuppies,"We couldn't be more pleased with the Mini Bernedoodle puppy we acquired from Levi Glick. She is so sweet, and all our friends find her just the cutest little girl. Clearly, she was raised in a loving home. Beyond that Levi was the ultimate professional is our conversations, in our meeting with him and with his follow up check in on our puppy. Our vet pronounced her in good health and was pleased our pup's vaccinations were up to date, she had been micro-chipped by Levi and she was free of parasites due to Levi's de-worming regimen.",5
keystonepuppies,Great experience all around! We love our little girl and couldn’t imagine life without her!,5

Thank you to John and Keystone Puppies!!",5
keystonepuppies,"We adopted 2 of the most adorable and loveable puppies, Dice and Domino!  Steven knew how to care for these little guys.  When we went to pick them up he had bathed them and made sure they were dewormed.  Their first series of shots were already completed and they had a health check by a vet.  Our experience with Steven was memorable. Now that they are 5 months old they are still as happy and healthy as can be.  Our kids love them and they have become the best 2 new additions to our family!",5

We made several trips back making sure we were picking the right one of the litter. David never got annoyed and answered all questions. The dog aka Pink, now Lilly is being crate trained and smart as a whip and very content. Thanx DavidSteve Becker",5

Very flexible with the pickup time since we were traveling 7 hours to pick the puppy up. thank you very much for Chipper he is so sweet and has been a wonderful addition to our family.,5
keystonepuppies,"We bought our Luna through Keystonypuppies.com. We were set on having a  purebred GSD with a good lineage and it was very important for us to have a healthy puppy with a good temperament. Since we are a new family, we wanted a dog that was raised around children and very friendly. We were doing our research for months until we stumbled on adorable puppies by Sam Blank.Sam and his wife have been in the business for over 10 years and their puppies are bred to perfection. They are healthy, the parents are always genetically screened for any genetic bone malformations and any other issues. I truly believe that a breeder that conducts genetic testing is especially important if you are planning on purchasing a purebred dog!I have personally looked at the kennels where the dogs are kept and they are clean with no odor! One can always tell how the dogs really get treated by their kennels. They take care of those kennels daily and the dogs are healthy and always surrounded by love.Thank you Keystone Puppies and Sam Blank for selling us our little fur baby. We truly can’t imagine our life without her. She is perfectly trained and training her was so easy. Our puppy is caring and sympathetic and is always in tune with our emotions. After having such a perfect pup we are ONLY going to Sam Blank for our next GSD puppy!THANK YOU!",5

Gully was SO incredibly well socialized by the time I got him, he's just the happiest puppy and loves all people and animals. Everyone who meets him comments on how happy and adorable he is. He really has the sweetest disposition.Mr. Ebersole was terrific to work with and provided all the documentation for his first set of vaccinations. I've sent him a few updates and he always responds so positively to see how Gully is growing, you can tell how much he cares for his puppies. I would absolutely recommend Marvin Ebersole for anyone looking for a miniature labradoodle!",5

I felt instantly comfortable with where our puppy was coming from. They were easy to work with and we had our puppy in less than a week after I first contacted them. The communication with Keystone Puppies was just as great and I would absolutely trust them again. They were quick to provide all transportation information to us and stayed in constant contact with us the day of our puppy's travel. They even checked flights for different days to get the easiest/shortest travel day for our pup to decrease the stress of traveling for her. I will forever recommend Keystone Puppies to anyone I know who is looking for their newest family member.,5

keystonepuppies,"Couldn't Be Happier!  We adopted our new family member, a Cavapoo named Luke from breeder, Enos Esh, and we picked him up in Denver on Jan. 4th.  The whole operation went so smoothly until American Airlines cargo pickup messed up on this end, but that's another story.  Luke did arrive eventually, and after flying from PA with a layover at O'Hare in Chicago, he seemed pretty much untramatized.  Shawn with Keystone and Enos were so easy to talk to and coordinated every step for us.  We have had Luke almost a week now, and he has adapted to his forever home with ease.  Luke is so intelligent and affectionate and wants to be around his humans all the time. We are looking forward to many many WOOFY happy times with him.  Kudos to Shawn and Enos!",5

keystonepuppies,"Although the puppy did end up arriving as planned, I received no communication regarding shipping, including flight number and receipt of payment.

keystonepuppies,"After our old shelter dog died in his sleep, we knew we needed another dog. We searched shelters on-line without success and then started to look for a puppy. One look at ""Freddy"" at Keystone Puppies had us hooked, and we were somehow lucky enough to get him from Mary Liz King. We renamed him Festus, and he is the sweetest dog we've ever known. He's healthy, beautiful, calm, and wonderfully affectionate. We couldn't be happier.",5

keystonepuppies,"Shawn was great! Communication was excellent throughout the entire process, making purchasing and shipping our mini Goldendoodle a very positive experience.Highly recommend Keystone Puppies!",5
keystonepuppies,"Quite expensive. But as you can’t find any way to find an AKC registered puppy locally anymore I guess we’re stuck buying them through on line shippers. Animal activists have driven honest breeders to hide behind “Shippers” to stay in business or for amateur breeders to sell a litter of pups.That being said: Doing business with Keystone   was both smooth, professional and pleasant. Both  the Shipper and the Breeder we’re great to deal   with in this case. This is the second time I used  Keystone to buy an AKC registered puppy. The first time the Breeder was not the best I’ve ever delt with. So be where your are dealing with two separate people and paying them individually",5
keystonepuppies,"Keystone Puppies are very professional and efficient! Got my puppy within a week. Thank you so much, Wes is great!",5

keystonepuppies,"We got our puppy in September at about 14 weeks old. The five hour drive home was a breeze without accidents, crying or signs of anxiety. He adjusted to his new home right away! He has slept eight hours straight from night one, making crate training a breeze. We highly recommend this breeder who was more than accommodating.",5
keystonepuppies,"I bought a German Shepherd puppy from a breeder(Ezra Smucker) in PA. From the time I called him to the time I took the puppy home was a great experience. He answered all our questions, and was accommodating when we arrived to his house. Mr. Smucker has a lovely home and family. He takes care of his dogs very well. The dog is healthy and happy. I highly recommend Ezra Smucker to anyone who wants a dog.",5
keystonepuppies,We found our baby German Shepherd through keystone puppies. We were very happy with the overall experience. Lots of helpful information available on the page listing to help us understand expectations for the puppy and the process.,5
keystonepuppies,"We received our mini bernedoodle about a month ago. The breeder Elam Fisher from Maryland was courteous and punctual in getting Pote (pronounced Pohtee) (formerly known as Gumby) to the vet to get his flight health certificate. Although he arrived scared and timid, from the flight, it didn’t take long for him to be his playful self. Shawn at Keystone was wonderful to work with as well.  He was able to answer all of my questions to ease my mind that this wasn’t a scam and kept me informed once he picked Pote up from the breeder until his flight landed. Bless Pote’s heart, his flight was delayed 5 hours. He is now my sidekick and shadow and is so full of himself.  Trust Keystone and the breeders they promote for your next furbaby.  We are in LOVE with ours.",5

We could tell that our puppy was very well cared for when we got him. Our puppy is now doing great and is very healthy and happy. :)",5
keystonepuppies,Puppy mill puppies? Possibly. She was 5 months old when we got her; not house trained and didn’t eat on a regular schedule. Only ate food off the floor. She was scared of the bowl! Here we are two months later and I am still having a hard time house training her. Her vet records were sketchy and when I asked for the rabies tag the owner said the vet was behind on paperwork. That sounded like a BS story to me. Never did get the tag. So I had to get her dewormed and her shots myself to make sure she was vaccinated.Those things aside she is the joy of our lives and has brought life back into our family after our last dog passed away. We are SO glad to have such a sweet lovable dog. She is our baby.,3
keystonepuppies,I had a great experience. My puppy is so playful and lovable. The seller was so nice and kind and very informative about the puppies.  Thank you so very much!!!,5
keystonepuppies,The process was very smooth. Our dog is such a great pup. He was very well taken care of. All paperwork was legit. Price was great as well. Highly recommend,5
keystonepuppies,"I love my Mini Australian Shepherd! She is a sweet girl and very smart. I gave 4 stars only because in researching other breeders (after my purchase), I found that there are other breeders who expose their weaned pups to crates, and even some basic house training. This would have been very helpful, especially because “Gracie” was already nearly 3 months old when we adopted her. She was never inside a house, never crated and lived in a barn until I brought her here to her forever home. That said, she became our little girl immediately and we love her to pieces! Can’t imagine life without her. The breeders we got her from were very sweet and I got to meet Gracie’s mamma and another litter mate. The family included 4-5 small children who were very active in playing with the puppies and it was good to know she had been exposed to several very enthusiastic children of varying ages. I was pleased that her vaccines were current for her age and that she’d been wormed. She’s been very healthy so far and good natured, albeit a bit shy around people and other dogs she doesn’t know. (Typical for her breed) All in all, we are very happy “hoomans”! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",4
keystonepuppies,The German Shepherd is fine!!! But the breeder had her past the where he should had gotten her some shots . She was over 16weeks . He negotiated the price to compensate the shots.,3
keystonepuppies,No review text found,5
keystonepuppies,Moses is the most amazing and genuine person I’ve met! He is clearly not solely in it for the money. I had some issues with my pet as he got sick and passed away for I came to get him but Moses took the time to come up with a deal that worked for the both of us and he’s just an awesome guy.,5
keystonepuppies,"I’m so tired of reading reviews about how people had a bad experience. Not everything will be perfect that’s life . I got my amazing handsome puppy from Mel blank. I drove 5 hours to get my lil guy. 5 there 5 back and I would do it all over again. The breeder was very nice and very clean environment. They even gave me an amazing price. Only thing he said was his testicle did not drop yet. And it did after a week he was in 100% health. He was afraid at first but that’s normal it’s not abuse. He’s already 6 1/2 months old golden retriever I get people coming to him every day saying how beautiful he is . Oh and get this, he peed on the mats when I first got him home. Melvin blank is a great person and breeder! This is my first time owning a dog and even though it’sa ton of work, I would never trade it for anything. Pups are a lot of work and trying to blame the breeder is wrong. So to all you people out there do YOUR RESEARCH! Ask questions. If you have a bad feeling move on. Ok well thank you so much keystone puppy’s !",5
keystonepuppies,"This is an Amish operation. People who view animals as work and money. They have no compassion toward animals, so your most likely getting a puppy mill animal.",1

keystonepuppies,"I got a Cockapoo from Keystone Puppies last September (Sept. 2021). Since it was my first time to have a puppy, I didn't know the process how to adapt a puppy. But Keystone Puppies followed up with me well so I didn't have any difficulty to adapt him though they are not tech-persons :). When I picked up my puppy from the airport, I was scared because my puppy braked too loudly and aggressively. I worried about having a not-friendly puppy but as soon as I put him outside of the cage, he calmed down right away and sat in my lap in the car on the way home. As Keystone Puppies mentioned, he is very social and friendly and smart. My family is really happy with him.",5
keystonepuppies,"had a good experience overall. my only disappointment would be that the puppy had fleas and having another one at home caused a bit of angst on my part. had both groomed and then made sure their toys and beds were disinfected. other than that, we are all very happy with our cavapoo(now 17 weeks) and mini poodle (20 months)we also got through keystone. thank you!!",4

keystonepuppies,"**Edited to add: I did follow up with our breeder and he has been more than kind and helpful, even following up later to see how our puppy is doing. According to our conversations, he said he plans to reimburse us for the vet visit and medication from our puppy's illness.Original review:I had a good experience with Keystone Puppies. This was my first puppy buying experience (rather than a rescue) and I got exactly the right puppy for my family. The only glitch in our experience was that we did bring home a puppy who was sick with parasites which has cost us a considerable amount in vet fees during his first month with us, but I honestly don't know how uncommon that is. We have a new family member that we are in love with, and he's on the mend, so I'll give our overall experience a good rating.",5
keystonepuppies,I purchased a Shih Tzu puppy from from Keystone Puppies (David S.) and the entire process was stress free and flawless.

keystonepuppies,"New puppy owner and while searching for a Mini-Goldendoodle, Keystone Puppies was referred by a friend. We did our search, fell in love with the mini we wanted. My husband reached out to the seller who was so kind and informative. Same day, we drove after work to their beautiful home to pick up our precious Bella (her profile name was Daisy). She was up to date with her shots & we were given her official paperwork & extra food to get us started.We love her so much, she is perfect. Thank you!!",5

keystonepuppies,The sellers were extremely responsive and extremely nice to work with! I would highly recommend Keystone Puppies and the seller I worked with to anyone! Great experience!,5
keystonepuppies,"The overall experience was really good.   The breeder was fantastic; so, hopefully that means Keystone Puppies is doing a good job of vetting them and not just luck. The puppy air transport service was really, really communicative, easy to work with, and helpful. I only go 4 stars because it was unclear how payments were to be competed and took a number of old fashioned phone calls to work out - web site was no help. Also want sure about guarantees, but everything worked out and we love our puppy.",4
keystonepuppies,"We had an excellent experience with Mel and Ruth.  We decided to adopt Luke and made arrangements to meet up with Mel for the pickup.  On arrival Luke was adorable, but so was his sister Lizzy, we decided that we had to keep the kids together, so we adopted Lizzy as well.  Both checked out well at my vet, and they are adorable sweet additions to our family.  Thanks for the wonderful puppies.",5

keystonepuppies,"I came across Keystone through multiple Google searches reviewing puppy breeders. My family and I were previously scammed leaving my 2 boys very disappointed. What I found comforting were the accreditations and guarantees that were listed and associated with each breeder and through Keystone.The process was extremely easy and quick. When I contacted the breeder, he was extremely genuine, I could tell he and his family really cared for the litter of puppies and they were well taken care of and loved.I knew with our families schedule and trying to make our new puppy a suprise for our kids, we would need our puppy to fly from Pittsburgh, PA to Boston, MA. I spoke with Sean, the owner of Keystone. He was friendly and helpful. He was able to accommodate us right away. He provided communication throughout the process while our breeder took the necessary steps to make sure the puppy was healthy and ready to go. Our puppy came with his paperwork and food attached to the top of a kennel/ crate. We received a folder from Keystone a few days later with a congratulations letter and other documentation.This was a new process for me and the first puppy for our family.  I would recommend Keystone and Green Forest Kennels.",5
keystonepuppies,"Keystone Puppies made the process easy and pleasant to get our new baby.  Shawn set up shipping arrangements for her and took care of everything.

keystonepuppies,Keystone Puppies delivered just as they said they would. I was afraid to ship a dog on a plane but when we picked her up she was a happy little puppy who had not been traumatized a bit. She was with many other dogs who were picked up as well. She is adorable and we immediately fell in love with Milly. She loves the outdoors and she has adopted our other dog as her Mom. Our only challenge is training her to stop biting with her sharp little teeth. I would highly recommend Keystone Puppies 5*,5
keystonepuppies,"I was looking for a chihuahua and checked all the local rescues and animal shelters. All required a fenced in yard. I don't.  I googled Keystone puppies and found a small, accredited breeder.  Called and set up a time to visit. Went to the farm and was very impressed.  I am anti puppy mill person  and didn't know what to expect.  The puppies were in the home and it was very nice. One little girl came over to me so I knew it was the one. Took her home and named her Fiona Rose.  She was 3 pounds and full of energy. She was very well taken care of, no fleas or ticks. She is the sweetest little girl and loves her new family. The breeder was in Honeybrook,  pa. I will go back to them if and when I want another dog.",5

keystonepuppies,"This is my second time purchasing a dog using your site.  My first experience was fabulous.  The first time, the owner had Mom on site and was able to answer all questions I had about the breed, pups, mom, and dad.  Unfortunately my most recent experience was not the same.  The owner of the puppies had no idea about Mom's or Dad's color, weight, breed, etc. and said she was selling for a friend.  I was going to leave without buying a puppy because it did not seem like a legitimate breeder; however, I felt so bad leaving the puppies, so I purchased one.  I was not happy and actually upset because they represent your organization.  I wish I had a better experience.",2

I had a good feeling from the beginnings of our communications.Our newly acquired puppy is a complete joy, and she is making us extremely happy.She’s acclimating herself quite well to the house, and barely has had an accident so far.I am so very grateful I found David and Mary. I have no doubt this golden puppy will be a wonderful companion for our family for many years to come.It is clear they care deeply about providing healthy, happy puppies to a loving home, and that they do it for the love of the breed, not for greed.As a matter of fact, David followed up with me just yesterday, just to see how I was doing with our new addition.Hope this helps with building your confidence in acquiring a golden puppy from David and Mary, without worry.",5

keystonepuppies,"My puppy, goldendoodle Tootsie renamed Rosie, was purchased from Elmer Fisher of Ronks Pa.I totally recommend this breeder, I saw Rosie's Mom/Dad and grandfather at this beautiful well mantained farm.Elmer and his children were kind and charming, no pressure just beautiful puppies. It was difficult to choose just one, luckily Rosie chose me.She is, by far the easiest puppy I ever had.She was 8 weeks old, now 14 weeks she is housebroken, knows her name, sit, down, off and no bite ( very important) and has just this week completed the Olympic feat of going up and down the 13 steps in my foyer. Whew, she was getting heavy.My grand daughter was the one that found all the puppies I looked at, I was ready to put it off when she discovered Keystone. We looked at three other sets of pups, in person, none of the puppies or breeders and housing could compare to Elmer's puppies. Those were from other Websites.10 stars to my granddaughter for persistence9 stars to Elmer for taking care in what he does.8 stars to Tina and Prince, Rosie's Mom and Dad for having 9 beautiful pups.7 stars to my daughter for driving from NJ to Pa many times looking at pups6 stars to me for my patience5 stars to Keystone for having such a wonderful breeder on their site.I am gearing towards a 'therapy dog' with this beautiful, friendly and eager to learn puppy. We start puppy classes next week and have signed up for 3 different programs.Thank you",5
keystonepuppies,"Transaction was easy.  Really nice, honest breeder.",5
keystonepuppies,"We lost our dog of 14 years this month and our hearts were broken. Finding a new companion was going to be difficult, as our last dog was the perfect dog. When doing research we stumbled upon Keystone Puppies, and found Mary. We fell in absolute love with one of her goldendoodle puppies. She was so easy to communicate with and answered all of our questions. She helped us pick the most perfect, loving, and cuddly puppy. All the puppies were well behaved and very clean. She gave us some dog food, a collar, and even puppy pads for our long trip home ( a little over two hours). We are head over heels for our new addition and have Mary Zook to thank. Without a doubt I would recommend to others to get a dog from her and her family !",5

keystonepuppies,"Overall a really Great Experience! This was my first puppy purchase. Sam & Linda Blank were so helpful, kind and attentive throughout the process of purchasing my German Shepherd. Linda made sure I had all the proper paperwork after the point of sale. She also supplied me with food for her. Sam even called to check up on my  pup to see how she was transitioning. They both went above and beyond. I would definitely recommend Sam & Linda Blank. Top Breeders in my book.",5
keystonepuppies,"I got a red F1b female cavapoo named Nala on July 19th ‘21 from Chester Stoltzfus. I’ve had her for about 2 and a half wks now. She’s adorable, very smart and such a doll. The entire process was quick and easy. I called Chester and spoke with his wife. I told her which one I wanted (which was already sold) and she told me which puppies were available. I then picked Nala and waited for her husband Chester to call me back. He explained the process and he gave me his bank information to process the transfer. I paid him completely in full (1960.00) rather than a deposit because I knew I wanted her for sure. I then got in contact with Sean (the owner of Keystone Puppies) and he helped me book a flight to ship her out (from PA to Sacramento, Ca) ASAP through American Airlines. Due to the weather we had to reschedule once but it was well in advance and never effected my schedule. He even let me pay the flight fee (625) through Apple Pay which made me a little nervous but all was worth it and trust worthy. She arrived with paperwork stating her info and some food. A week later in the mail, Keystone sent a folder with her info and receipt for what I paid the breeder. Her first appointment is August 21st because that’s all that’s available after calling several places. So she’s been quarantined for the most part. I’m hoping she’s just happy and healthy and doing well overall and will contact them immediately if theirs anything wrong or off. So far she seems happy and healthy and has been a blast. I def recommend Keystone and will definitely come back in the future. I ran into so many scams before finding this place and I’m so grateful for that.",5
keystonepuppies,I got the perfect dog for me . And she was shipped from PA to LA .Thank You  Keystone,5
keystonepuppies,Keystone is very easy to navigate and helped me greatly in finding the perfect puppy for me. Abner (the breeder) was so kind and helpful throughout the process as well. Overall amazing experience!.,5
keystonepuppies,I had a great experience. I spoke with Chester on the phone multiple times throughout the adoption process and he was happy to be flexible and answer all of my questions. The pick up process was seamless and easy. My vet confirmed that my puppy is healthy. I’ve already referred Chester to a family friend who also had a great experience! My puppy is very smart and playful and we couldn’t be more pleased. Thank you!,5

keystonepuppies,"Our experience with Keystone puppies was excellent. There was good communication with the breeder. He answered our questions & was flexible in arranging to get our puppy. We just came from our Vet, declared the puppy healthy .I would give 5 stars!!",5
keystonepuppies,The purchase & arrival of my puppy was very smooth. I am so glad I pursued this option to adopt. We are extremely pleased with our new family addition,5
keystonepuppies,"We had not much luck finding a puppy, then I looked on Keystone! Found a cute puppy and contacted the breeder. Abner was great, answered all my question and was very honest. I told him I wanted the puppy but had to wait a week to go pick her up due to Father’s Day it was a 6 hour drive 1 way. He was willing to hold her and when we got  there the following week, everything went as planned. No hidden anything. They explained a few things we paid him and off we were with our new puppy! She has been a sweet addition to our family💕",5
keystonepuppies,"We just recently got our very first pet from keystone puppies. Having never purchased a dog before we were very trepidatious doing it over the internet no less. We live in California and bought our puppy from a breeder all the way across the country in Pennsylvania. Our entire experience with Keyston Puppies was painless, smooth, and quick to be honest. Our breeder was quick to answer all of our questions. Shawn our shipping coordinator from Keyston was amazing. He also was quick to answer all of our questions and gave continuous updates on the shipping process of our puppy. We couldn’t be happier with our little Max, and all for half the price we would have paid here for him in California. Highly recommend Keyston Puppies.",5
keystonepuppies,"I am delighted with my Corgi puppy Mason (now Teddy) from Stephen King. He is the calmest, most loving little guy I've had in years. Working with Mr King was a pleasure, everything as promised. I couldn't be happier.",5

keystonepuppies,"I love Keystone Puppies -- this was my first time purchasing a puppy through a website, so I was very worried that it would not be legit.  The site is awesome and the breeder was amazing.  Our puppy could not be flown out to us because it is too hot in San Antonio, but it was no problem for us to fly out and get our new member to our family.  Bounce is absolutely amazing an I would choose Keystone over and over again for a puppy.",5
keystonepuppies,"Stephen took good care of the puppies. My puppy was very loving, healthy and used to children.He even offered me an extra discount.He had all the puppies records and paperwork well organize and available.I will get another puppy from him.Thank you",5
keystonepuppies,I had a great experience and we love our dog Duke.,5

keystonepuppies,"I purchased a Boston Terrier from Gideon Fisher. Gideon was excellent to work with. He was professional and very responsive and answered all my questions and concerns. When I went to pick out my puppy the puppies were all clean and well kept. I'm very happy with my choice and the puppy. Should I want another Boston in the future, I will reach out to Gideon. Thank you for giving me a positive experience.",5

She was very professional, she had a folder for us to ready and for us to keep with his birthday and medical records.",5

keystonepuppies,"We recently welcomed a German Shepherd puppy into our family, through Keystone Puppies. We purposefully tracked down our breeder through KP, after a wonderful experience with our previous German Shepherd, Daphne, who passed away in February. We were absolutely heartbroken to lose her, so we managed to track down her breeder, and lo and behold, he had a female puppy, who just happened to be our Daphne's niece! The whole experience was very positive, and we are thrilled to have Ziva!",5
keystonepuppies,Well overall awesome and fot a perfect rottie. However after a daughter father inbred great dane from Mariam hoover. May have spelled 1st name wrong.,3
keystonepuppies,My experience with Keystone was a good one.  I did a lot of research before I got a puppy and from beginning to end things went well.  The breeder I got my puppy from was helpful and answered my questions.  I would use Keystone again in the future.,5
keystonepuppies,"I am extremely happy with our puppy! David is an amazing breeder! He is attentive, honest and super nice! His family was friendly and great! My son was super excited with his surprise! David very good at responding and making sure all was good at the time of pick up.",5
keystonepuppies,High recommend Keystone puppies and the breeder of our new puppy.,5

keystonepuppies,From beginning to end the process of picking up our new pup was seamless.  The breeder was incredibly helpful but at the same time it was evident he wanted the pup going to a great home.  My Mini golden doodle is now 3 months and just beautiful.  Thank you,5
keystonepuppies,"I have been wanting a cavachon for about a year. My search started locally (San Francisco Bay area) but nothing to be found. Google search led me to Keystone along with a couple others. The price range on the Keystone Puppy website fitted me.Ok so I originally wanted a cavachon named Chip but when I called to buy him, the breeder's wife, Ruth, said he was sold.So I continued looking and Champ happened to be the brother of Chip but the picture of Champ didnt seem too appealing. However after watching the video of the puppies and determining who Champ was in the video, I decided let's just do it.So I called back Ruth and said I would like to buy Champ. Gave her my CC info and that was that. I purchased Champ with minutes. I was excited to meet him and anxious the his arrival.After that I called Shaun to arrange a flight. Champ was purchased on a Tuesday and Shaun got back to me with the details/itinerary.A few days prior to the flight, the vet must check the dog, make sure everything is ok. Ruth was informed that Champ had umbilical hernia. Being a 1st time dog owner I had no idea what that was so I told her no, I dont want Champ. Then I check youtube, google, and turns out umbilical hernia is common and can be remediated with surgery. Also I went back to keystone website and noticed that Chuck, the other brother of Champ, was lower in price. Called Ruth back and let her no that I will keep Champ at a lower cost. Champ was 1250. We agreed on 800 because of the surgery and the lowered price of Chuck. She was nice to that for me. Thank you RUTH and husband. Husband seems a bit irked by it but I guess I would be as well. The breeders also agreed to pay for the umbilical hernia surgery which is scheduled but hasnt been done yet.So I finally get Champ at the cargo area at American airlines. It's a 8 hr trip so obviously the pup may be grumpy, whiny, dirty, etc. Champ was dirty but none of the other things. He was a happy lil boy. Once I got home it was straight to the kitchen sink for a bath and being the first time doing g this with a puppy i didnt know what to expect. I was expecting Champ to not want to do this but it was the total opposite. It seemed to me that he knew he had pee and poop on him and knew he needed a bath.Champ is totally a cutie. I love this pup! His affection and him just being him really brightens up my day. He is super funny too.After bath I dried him well and he was happy yet kind of wondering and just taking in the new environment. All is going well. I placed potty pads in a room I cleared out to be his room and the training begins. I was surprised how obedient he is, how smart, and how well he can understand what we need to happen here. A few slip ups but overall, WOW, so impressed with his portu training. Also impressed with his ""fetch"" game, and his ability to sit when I tell him.I am very happy with Champ. The experience exceeds my expectations.Now I am just waiting for the surgery and to see if the breeders can withhold our agreement about paying the cost of the surgery and that's it.I would totally reccomend keystone and ruth and Steve fisher the breeders.  Shaun was great at keeping me posted on Champ's status during his flight. Thank you thank you thank you!",5
keystonepuppies,"Easy and fast transaction but have to go back another day fir mode of payment, was not informed that credit card is not accepted",4
keystonepuppies,This was our first time getting a puppy thru your company and it was easy and painless.  Omar and his family were great and when we saw of puppy we feel in love.  It’s been over month with our new family member and it’s been great!  A great addition to our family!Thank you,5
keystonepuppies,"My new puppy is wonderful- playful, sweet, healthy.  The reason I rated 4 starts instead of 5 is that I was not given the chance to see the pup's parents or really get a good look at the conditions she was born and raised in.  The breeder would not allow us to come into the house, stating she had ""just washed the floors"" so we conducted the transaction on the front porch.  I found that a bit odd given we had an appointment to pick up the puppy.  Also, the puppy smelled pretty bad when we picked her up.  The first thing I had to do when I got her home is give her a bath.  The breeder washed the floors but did not bathe the puppy before her new owner picked her up......",4
keystonepuppies,Excellent service!!! Lovely puppy!We are thrilled to have such a great addition to our family.Thank you!,5
keystonepuppies,"Just as advertised, very happy with our Burmese mountain dog. Perfect for Colorado!",5
keystonepuppies,"We are very satisfied, we have been to the vet and he thinks she is in great health.The breeder was very accommodating, I could not of asked for anything else.  Thank youPaul",5
keystonepuppies,"I purchased my puppy a few weeks ago. I was skeptical about sending money to a stranger in another state. But after talking to Shawn from Keystone I felt more at ease. I had a good experience with Daniel the breeder. He returns calls promptly and stayed in touch during the entire process. I was confused about which one I wanted because they all seemed cute in the pictures. Daniel was patient. I ended up with this little fellow named Chex who is indeed properly socialized and a smart puppy. I wanted this breed because I had read how smart they are and it's so true. It's been four days and he knows what rooms are off limits, knows where his feeding area is, he's starting to climb stairs, knows where to potty in the yard, and is adapting to walking on a leash.",5
keystonepuppies,"Very nice people. Charley is so sweet, we just love him!",5
keystonepuppies,Very good experience very well priced very friendly atmosphere healthy 🐶,5
keystonepuppies,We visited Keystone Puppies home and kennel and were greatly impressed with the operation and animals. The puppies were very clean and obviously well fed. We say the mother and she was clean and beautiful. the structures that housed the puppies was new and in great shape. A very clean operation.,5
keystonepuppies,"we had a great experience with merle. he was very honest and open. he only had two pups left, but you could tell they were loved and taken care of. our bernedoodle annie is such a sweet girl. she got a good bill of health, per vet she’s very healthy and she’s gonna be a big girl cause of her big paws!",5

keystonepuppies,"I had a phenomenal experience with Keystone Puppies & Steven and Rachel Fisher (Breeders) in particular. I spoke with Steven and Rachel several times leading up to my visit with my pup and they were able to answer any & all questions. When I arrived at their place in PA, I was able to spend some quality time with James Adam (Now Albie) before deciding he was the right puppy for me. So far, Albie is adjusting to city life well & Steven / Rachel have made it clear that communication lines are open should anything come up or if I have any additional questions. I couldn't be happier with the experience and outcome!",5
keystonepuppies,easy process.. great pup,5
keystonepuppies,"I got a Bernedoodle puppy from Merle Wenger in Hamburg, Pa. 3 weeks ago. I've had some really great dogs in my lifetime but she is by far the easiest, smartest, happiest (and cutest!) puppy I've ever had. Merle's home and grounds were absolutely spotless and his two Bernese Mountain dogs he has for breeding were beautiful (as were the rest of the litter) and you could tell were very well taken care of. They had the run of the huge property and weren't kept in pens which was nice to see. His wife and children were quite lovely as well!The whole experience was great and the price was amazing also. I highly recommend him as a breeder. Thanks Merle!",5
keystonepuppies,"We lost our 9 yr old golden retriever this past Mother’s Day and our hearts and home were empty and broken without her. We decided our family needed another dog but the scams and the pandemic pricing of litters out there on the internet was very disheartening to the point we almost gave up. Somehow my daughter came across your website and we found our next golden retriever and best friend Cedar.  We drove 5 hrs from Massachusetts to Pennsylvania to pick her up and it was the best decision we could have made. Talking with the breeder before hand and finally picking her up was flawless and we couldn’t be happier. No scams, over pricing or long waitlist for litters! We love her and she has help fix our broken hearts!! I have recommend this website many times over the past month to friends. Thank you somuch!!",5
keystonepuppies,Our little girl had her first visit with our vet and they said she is very healthy.  She has been very active and has taken over our house and hearts.  Love her - Thanks!,5
keystonepuppies,"I get to speak breeder directly. I can see where the breeder located so that I can find puppy with near by breeder. The whole experience was great. The breeder is an excellent lady to work with. She was very helpful and always picked up my phone. If she couldn’t pick up, she gave me call back right away. The is in excellent health condition. I can’t be more happy. This is our first puppy and she made the whole process seem less. The puppy got adjusted to us and the house right away. Thank you so much.",5
keystonepuppies,The breeder we got our Teddy from was wonderful.  His place was spotless.  He gave us food for Teddy's first week at home.  Our vets told us that our new puppy was just perfect.,5
keystonepuppies,"Dan (maybe Dave? I'm terrible with names) was fabulous. He was so helpful and accomidating. Our puppy is sweet, adorable, healthy, and playful. We will be going back to him if we ever want another. Can't thank him enough!",5
keystonepuppies,"Unfortunately we ran into a puppy mill scam with Omar Huyard, as well as him giving out bank information to others in his community.My partner and I ran into a family emergency after putting down a deposit for a $2,895 Cavapoo. The total deposit was $500. We should have known by the price it was a read flag. After talking things over with my partner we decided to ask Omar if he would settled for $2100 after our emergency and he refused.He then encouraged us to ask “trusted friends for money” and constantly kept pushing the subject and never focusing on the dog finding a good home.He was adamant about selling a puppy and was frustrated that I had emergency, it’s not like we weren’t going to offer him anything, he just wanted to have the price he wanted.Long story short, we have been fighting to get a deposit back from Omar even though, someone else ran my card, without my knowledge, as well as Keystone Puppies saying deposits are non-refundable and there is no such verbiage on their website. Stay away from Keystone!",1
keystonepuppies,We heard many horror stories about buying puppies online. We put if off for awhile until we heard from one of our friends who got their puppy thru keystone. So we decided to do the same and found our puppy to add to our family. We have nothing but good to say about the breeder and the shipper.Communication through Mr. Ephraim Esh and Shawn(The shipper) was very pleasant and easy. Shawn made sure that everything go smoothly for the puppy shipment. Thanks to these two gentlemen for their honesty in all the transactions.,5
keystonepuppies,I had a very good experience with Daniel. He was very friendly and knowledgeable of the puppies. He showed us Luna's Mom and Dad. She is a Pomsky Poodle.,5

keystonepuppies,Keystone puppies is great! Shawn gave me constants updates during the time our puppy was traveling to get to us. I will definitely recommend them to all my friends that want to add a furry baby in their lives.Caterina,5
keystonepuppies,The gentleman was very kind and took his time to explain the paperwork I was signing. I'm truly grateful! If we ever decide to add another member to our family I will definitely consider Me. Glick before going anywhere else! 😊,5
keystonepuppies,I purchased a shepherd puppy.  Was a good experience.  She came with her shot and worming records.  Very pleased would buy there again.,5
keystonepuppies,The process to purchase our new family member (puppy) was made so much easier by Keystone puppies. Our puppy “Gus” is very healthy and handsome and cuddly. Keystone puppies was the way to go and I’m so glad we had a smooth transition purchase with them.,5
keystonepuppies,The puppy has an excellent temperament and is a joy to have as a companion.  He is my 5th German Shepherd and I am aware of the breed’s many characteristics.,5
keystonepuppies,After I got scammed online I was hesitant about trying to get another puppy. I emailed my concerns and they understood.  I got matched up with a great breeder who I could meet myself and pay in person. And I got my perfect puppy who I love so much!!!! Thanks so much for everything!!!,5
keystonepuppies,I really enjoyed getting my puppy through the Keystone Puppies service. They are very reliable and made the process very easy. They followed up with many texts and emails that updated me about my puppy as well. My puppy arrived safely and overall they are a very good service.,5
keystonepuppies,I just wanna say i had an amazing experience with keystone puppies. My breeder dorthy was so nice and caring and her husband to. They took amazing care of our loving sliver lab Louie who is now 9 months. We are so blessed for this amazing puppy and the experience with it. This was our first puppy and had the best experience ever. THANK YOU KEYSTONE AND DORTHY. Please check they out they have new puppies who are very adorable. One more thing Louie had one ball missing and they were honest and told us all about and we were very grateful for that. THANK YOU ❤️,5
keystonepuppies,Stella our mini golden doodle puppy is the perfect addition to our family. We couldn’t be more happy with her and the experience with Keystone and John the breeder.,5
keystonepuppies,"My experience with my breeder Omar Huyard was wonderful! I currently have a 1 year old miniature poodle puppy that i bought from him almost a year ago. He was very patient, answered all of my questions, and even took time to introduce me to others who had recently bought puppies from him. My puppy was well socialized and loves people, dogs and mostly kids! Nobody is a stranger to her. She has been happy, incredibly playful, and healthy since the day that I got her. If I adopt another puppy it will definitely be from Omar!",5
keystonepuppies,Cute but oh so nervous and shy!  Training this puppy is more difficult than any other puppy I have had before.  Moving from the farm to the city has been almost traumatic for her and I hope she can adjust soon.  I have to wait until she gets the rest of her shots to get her into training school so thus far we are trying as best we can.  I am crate training her and she is so demanding or scared that when I leave the room she begins barking and does not stop until I return.  I can only assume that she does the same when I leave for a couple of hours.  Right now I feel frustrated and discouraged but love this adorable little pup and will continue to work on easing her into city life.  She likes other dogs and I will get her into puppy play group as soon as she finishes her shots next week.,2
keystonepuppies,we have had our little Springer doodle Izzy from the smucker family in PA for about a month now and she is doing amazing. She is very happy and healthy. Linda was very willing to work with us on picking up our puppy and worked with us on a pick up time since we were driving From NC . She did a great job with our puppy.,5
keystonepuppies,"I was very happy with the breeder I dealt with , Barbie was so personable with me and my husband .

keystonepuppies,"We had a great experience with our merle cavalier puppy ""Ash"", formerly Kibble.  Sam Blank got back to me immediately and even called 2 weeks after to see how everything was going!  We adore Ash and are so happy to have him.  His first vet appointment went great.  Sam's farm was beautiful and immaculate and we got to meet his German Shephard puppies and parents also (wish we could have adopted one of those too, adorable).  You could tell they really care about their animals! The few adults (cavalier mom and 2 shephards) were so well behaved.",5
keystonepuppies,"We love our puppy (formerly ""Chase""; renamed ""Mando"".  The only complaint is that his paperwork said that he bad been dewormed, but he has had worms ever since we got him.  This is even after being treated through 3 rounds of medications after which our vet said we can only hope he will outgrow it.Mando (""Chase"") has been a wonderful puppy in every other way and we really appreciate the breeder's daughters for pre-training him so well with ""sit"" and walking so nicely on a leash right from the start!  They also did a great job giving him a bath the day we picked him up.  Please thank the little ladies for us!Only one more minor thing though... the breeder promised to send Mando/Chase's pedigree paperwork, but it's been over 2 months and we haven't received them yet.",4

keystonepuppies,"I am writing to have other consumers be very aware of what they are buying. We purchased a ""mini labradoodle"" from Sam Blank in February. Within 24 hours, she needed a vet appointment, as she came home, sick,  with a parasite. We called to inform the breeder, just so he would know - and it went to voice mail. Not surprisingly, he never called back.As of this writing, the puppy is 20 weeks old, over 28 pounds, and about thirty inches long. She is not any kind of ""mini"". Additionally, she has no ""doodle"" at all in her appearance. We specifically requested, desired, searched for, and bought what we were told was a mini labradoodle. And we believe we were deceived.All that being said, we love our dog, and accept her for what she is. But having a larger dog does present problems for me - and I have trouble walking, carrying and controling her. I wish we would have been given a truthful bill of goods. The mother was with the puppies at first observation; we know that she was a golden lab. We were shown a picture of the father, and told it was a family member's mini poodle. Unfortunately, our puppy didn't get the mini poodle memo.Sam Blank said he would call in a couple of weeks, to check in on the puppy. Have you heard from him? We haven't. And so, for all these reasons, I would not recommend Keystone Puppies or Sam Blank - in the name of honesty and full disclosure.UPDATE: After posting the above review, Keystone Puppies contacted us, as did the breader Sam Blank, and reimbursed us for the vet costs we incurred in the first 24 hours after picking up our puppy. This is much appreciated and helpful. So thank you, Keystone Puppies, for really standing behind your service and making connections with your customers and your breeders.",3
keystonepuppies,"We are supremely happy with our newest addition to our family. He is healthy, happy, well adjusted and is great with the kids.

We endorse Keystone Puppies and recommend them to anyone looking to add a furry friend to their family.",5

keystonepuppies,The purchase of our silver Labrador Retriever from Elmer King was an exceptional experience from beginning to end. From the initial phone call Elmer answered all our questions and concerns. Upon pick up of our puppy Elmer had all the necessary paperwork and took the time to explain everything. He provided us with an extremely happy and healthy puppy confirmed by our veterinarian. To our surprise two weeks later Elmer called to check up on the puppy and how things were going. The small gesture was so greatly appreciated. Our puppy AJ is a wonderful dog and I would definitely recommend Elmer King to anyone looking for a puppy. Thank you Elmer.,5
keystonepuppies,"I was nervous to purchase a pup and have it shipped across the country (I'm in CA), but I shouldn't have been! The entire process was seamless from start to finish. Shawn stayed in very close contact on shipping day and I knew where our pup was at all times. She's gorgeous, healthy, socialized, and everything we wanted.A week after she arrived, Ephraim Stolzfus (breeder) called to check up on her and make sure I was happy. Excellent service, and would purchase a puppy from Ephraim a hundred times over.Will definitely be purchasing from Keystone Puppies again!",5

keystonepuppies,"I had been looking for a puppy for MONTHS and found many scams along the way, but it was completely worth the haasle and the wait to get a puppy from this breeder. The puppy's disposition is one of the best I have ever seen and he is everything I dreamed of for a service dog.The process was seamless and very positive. The dogs are raised in an ideal area with the perfect conditions for them to succeed. I would not trust any other golden retriever breeder - David made my dreams come true!",5

keystonepuppies,"Our puppy is doing well.  However, we drove over 2 hours to see our puppy and when we arrived and decided to take her home we were advised she had a hernia.  They did adjust the price according to their vets fee.The point of this matter is that we were going to breed her and after doing research and speaking to our vet, we learned this is a genetic disorder.  Being responsible pet owners we choose not to breed her.   We would have not traveled the 2 hour trip had we been advised of the hernia and this was a genetic disorder.   It was listed on the health record so the owner was aware of the hernia.We certainly love our puppy and she is doing very well, graduated from puppy kindergarten and await the next obedience class.  Our disappointment was not full disclosure on the phone prior to our trip and the fact that this was a genetic disorder.  This breeder should not be breeding the mother.Diane",2
keystonepuppies,The Fishers were easy to reach by phone and pleasant to deal with.  They called to make sure the Cavapoo puppy had arrived all right.  Shawn was wonderful on arranging a flight and on following through.  All good!,5

keystonepuppies,One of my friend got her favourite puppy from store and she is very happy thank you.....keystone puppies.,5
keystonepuppies,"Keystone puppies made the process of shipping a puppy to us very easy.  They took care of arranging the flights and ensuring that everything was in order for our puppy to come home.  They did offer insurance to cover the transportation of the puppy in the event of expiry during transport but there was not a formal certificate outlining what was covered.  The other thing that I would have appreciated was photo confirmation that the puppy that we purchased was the one that was delivered to the airport for transport.  Having said that, our puppy was fine during the flight and we received the puppy that we wanted and he's the best good boy!!!  Thank you Keystone!",4
keystonepuppies,This was a great experience and I'd highly recommend going through Keystone Puppies for your next furry family member.   Everyone was helpful and informative throughout the whole process.  And it took less than a week to get our new puppy!,5
keystonepuppies,I really like how organized and easy it was to pick up my puppy. All paperwork was done and they gave me a free small bag of dog food. I really liked the fact that we got to see the mother and now have a idea on how big she will be. The family that sold us the puppy were so nice and easy to talk to. I am definitely spreading the word of how happy I am to everything. Thank you. T.Gil,5
keystonepuppies,The transition between the sellers and us went very smooth we are 5 hours from where our corgi was sold to us and we wouldn't trade him for the world.what a great experience and the sellers were awesome people.,5

keystonepuppies,"We were unable to find any local young dogs or puppies in our area, so we began searching online. After doing as much research as we could on Keystone Puppies and the breeder, John Fisher, we went ahead and put our faith in this website. We kept our fingers crossed we weren't going to get scammed. John was a great communicator and returned every call. He was very knowledgeable about all his puppies, which showed us that he truly cares about his puppies and puts in time with them.  The first 2 puppies we inquired about were already adopted, but John went above and beyond to work with us, which was much appreciated since we live out of state.  We also appreciated his honesty, patience and kindness throughout the entire process.Darla, who is now known as Parsley, is a very energetic but sweet final piece to our family. We love her!",5
