Such consultant is Maranda M with whom I have the pleasure of talking with.  Maranda has convinced me on what plan to get and the company (IMG) that is behind the policy.

But even though I didn't purchase anything from AARDY that time, the rep left a positive impression on me!So today as I was preparing for another trip (for which I do not need personal liability), I remembered AARDY and went to the company website. From the chat with Sarah via the website to the phone calls with Nicole all the way to the final emails, I felt the process was seamless!During our webchat, Sarah also offered to have someone call us in case that was helpful.When Nicole called us, she was able to understand our concerns and highlight the corresponding features of the plan proposed for us so that we didn't need to buy more insurance than we needed. Sometimes one can feel overwhelmed with all the benefits and coverage components, but thanks to Nicole, I felt like I understood what I needed to know. I also appreciated that travelers in two different age categories could be handled within the same plan.The lookback period of the plan they proposed is less than some of the other plans out there so that's worth keeping in mind if you are looking for travel medical insurance.When we made our final decision, it was wonderful to call back and be able to conclude the purchase with Nicole.

AARDY,"I signed up for insurance for an upcoming trip, entering my name and age, and my wife's name and age as part of the early setup. I selected a recommended policy and paid for it. When I received the confirmation email, I went to double-check the policy and found that my name was listed as both the primary and secondary insured person. Not sure where the web processing messed that up, but certainly the checks for issuing a policy should ensure that the same person isn't listed multiple times. So then I had to call in to get the change made, wait on hold several times, receive instructions for how to modify the policy, and then find out it may take longer for that change to take effect than the time we'll be away on the trip!

I was unaware of this until I checked my VISA credit card account regarding the end of our billing cycle. I then noted your company had submitted to our credit card two charges, each in the amount of $1514.60. We called your company on 9/19/23. The agent cancelled policy TCLX284024469, issuing a credit to our VISA account.However, the email regarding this cancellation stated it would take 3-8 business for the refund to post to our account.The result is that I have had to now pay 2 charges, each in the amount of $1514.60 to my credit card company since the billing cycle has ended. I now have to wait for my refund that will appear on my next credit card statement.Needless to say, these developments have made me rather unhappy with the service provided.Sincerely, SJW",1.0,policy tclx tclxupdated review regarding recent travel insurance purchasethough initially pleased service subsequent development necessitate contacting youit turn two insurance policy issued rather one unaware checked visa credit card account regarding end billing cycle noted company submitted credit card two charge amount called company agent cancelled policy tclx issuing credit visa accounthowever email regarding cancellation stated would take business refund post accountthe result pay charge amount credit card company since billing cycle ended wait refund appear next credit card statementneedless say development made rather unhappy service providedsincerely sjw

I had done some research ahead of time and narrowed down the most important coverage for me and my companion. Most of those details were covered by the policy comparison function on the web page.

The policy I bought after speaking to Amanda cost about half the price of the one I had previously researched elsewhere (on a site where a chat bot sent me in circles trying to answer basic questions).

I found them accidentally while researching the myriad, overwhelming options for trip insurance out there and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. Christiane answered the phone immediately (no hold times or annoying AI) and it was clear I was dealing with a knowledgable professional (not someone at a call center pushing a particular product).After carefully listening and getting the details of my dream trip to India, Christiane quickly whittled my choices down to a few insurers with salient options based on my circumstance, recommended coverage limits, reimbursement rates, etc. She even held my hand through checking what coverage was available with my credit card to alleviate my concerns about having overlapping policies and insurers pointing the finger if I needed to file a claim.Christiane then went above and beyond by allowing me time to check with my health insurer about their coverage for international travel. We hung up, and incredibly, she called me back on the dot at the agreed upon time. What vendor does that these days?!Long story short, tripinsure101.com and Christiane alleviated all the anxiety, confusion, and stress around selecting the right trip insurance coverage for my dream trip. She coordinated the coverage beautifully around everything I already had in place to avoid overlap and provide me with the best, most affordable rate. There was no hard sell and I was treated with the utmost respect and courtesy.

They also try to make me sound like a liar by saying: ""You said the luggage was lost but you never provided proof of that"". After weeks of no update on my luggage, the airline said they think it's lost. At that point I sent an email to this con of a company saying, my baggage might be lost, how do I update the claim? They never replied or acknowledged this. They never asked me to provide proof, so I assumed they never even got it or got around to seeing it. I have documentation between myself and the airline back and forth for weeks!!! Absolutely disgusting, vile people run this company. If you know how insurance companies work, the one assigned to your claim gets a commission of the money that they DONT pay you, the customer. And it shows.Dont waste your money on these con artists. They'll never pay you anyway.I'm not sure but I think this company might be a scam. I travelled a month and a half ago and got the insurance which I usually get and never needed until now. My luggage was misplaced by the airline for over 3 weeks, so I had to buy some stuff to replace until/if it was found. The maximum is $400 and we only needed $250. I filed the claim a month and a half ago and when I checked in multiple times, I get vague answers and the chat rep was extremely rude telling me that ""it's only been a few weeks"".

roamright,"The pandemic caused governments to close down countries and activities.  So this effectively cancelled all travel, vacations etc and the operator could not put on the camp trip.

Africa Air defaulted (bankrupt) and would not refund our $1500 in flights. We had to pay for different flights, which cost more. Our claim was denied by RoamRight because So.

roamright,Very bad experience with roam right insurance.  Bought insurance for 11 people with cancellation for any reason.  Three of our family members didn't make the flight after getting to the airport 2 1/2 hours before take off.  Line was horribly long.  We were all together and 3 of our family members were right behind us but obviously not fast enough.  They shut the doors and only 8 of us made it on.  Told everyone not to worry because we had insurance and could cancel for any reason.  We lost the airline tickets from Southwest and bought Frontier tickets but insurance decided to not help us out since it wasn't written in the contract that way.  What a waste of money to buy insurance.,1.0,bad experience roam right insurance bought insurance people cancellation reason three family member didnt make flight getting airport hour take line horribly long together family member right behind u obviously fast enough shut door u made told everyone worry insurance could cancel reason lost airline ticket southwest bought frontier ticket insurance decided help u since wasnt written contract way waste money buy insurance

roamright,"We requested and were sold a Covid coverage policy for Turks &Caicos for $285 for two people and were  not sent an accompanying letter which said we had covid 19 coverage.

We were unable to reach anyone in the Arch RoamRight office, but finally got the emergency evacuation person. She found someone on Saturday afternoon that could send us the correct form that finally allowed us to get clearance to the island.  It was a very unnecessarily stressful situation caused by Arch documentation of Covid coverage that was not provided initially.  I called for a partial refund and the agent refused.

sevencorners,"Travel insurance purchased for an Israel trip, which has been cancelled and refunded for obvious reasons.  Seven Corners is unwilling to refund the travel insurance.  Granted, the contract states there is only a 14 day grace period, but given the circumstances in Israel and the fact Seven Corners had no outlay of money we thought they would promote customer relations and refund the money.  But they are refusing.  Yes, you can use the policy on another trip, but I was honest with them and stated that likely won't happen.  I also asked if the premium paid could be used for a number of smaller trips, but the response so far has been no (""the system doesn't allow"").

I submitted complete claim form along with a spread sheet listing each expense, copies of invoices, explanation of costs as well as proof of payment for each expense.  I was reimbursed a total of $1098.  This is a net of $450 after the premium.    Important to note is that any related physical therapy or other expenses 90 days past the date of incident were denied!  Not only did the insurance cover a pittance of my total cost, it took 18 months to recover this measly sum and the cost of my time to pursue this claim far exceeds the reimbursed amount.  The  amount of paperwork they requested in addition to the receipts and proof of payment was nothing short of nauseating.It is BLANTANTLY evident that Seven Corners modus Operandi revolves around finding flimsy excuses to either deny claims outright or systematically drain the claimant will to pursue rightful compensation.

sevencorners,"Well, this is a good time for me to write one of two reviews.I have used Seven Corners many times before, but I have never put in a claim.  Today I did because my flight from Italy back to the US was outright cancelled after being delayed for six plus hours.  We had to spend another night and had to leave the next morning.  The airline paid for the hotel so I did not add that to my claim.  Only food, taxi transportation and one clothing item because I was cold.The claim was fairly easy to input although I had to send the validating documents separately because it kept deleting them (file was too big which I found odd since it was just a few receipts).  I sent them directly to their customer service email.I chose 4 stars for good phone customer service and some direction on the site that I had difficulty using.What remains to be seen is the ease of getting the few hundred dollars I submitted paid to me.

sevencorners,When looking at travel insurers make sure you only pay attention to reviews where claims were filed. We had a flight cancelled from Atlanta to Asheville NC after we’d been traveling for 28 hours straight from Germany. They rebooked our family of 5 all on separate flights over the course of two separate days including my 8 year old. It wasn’t an option for her to fly alone. There was not a single rental car available in a 30 mile radius for drop off in Asheville so we hired a very expensive Uber. In my claim I made clear that we were not expecting full reimbursement but did expect some kind of relief. Maybe fair market value of a rental car driven 200 miles (even though none were available). They denied our claim because they only cover “local” transportation. How in the world am I supposed to get home from Germany using only local transportation?? I guess they expected us to stay in Atlanta and fly one by one back to Asheville over two days with my 8 and 12 year olds by themselves. I’ll never use this company again and will happily tell anyone who brings up the subject of travel insurance about my experience. Save your money…you may need it for “non-local” transporation.,1.0,looking travel insurer make sure pay attention review claim filed flight cancelled atlanta asheville nc wed traveling hour straight germany rebooked family separate flight course two separate day including year old wasnt option fly alone single rental car available mile radius drop asheville hired expensive uber claim made clear expecting full reimbursement expect kind relief maybe fair market value rental car driven mile even though none available denied claim cover local transportation world supposed get home germany using local transportation guess expected u stay atlanta fly one one back asheville two day year old ill never use company happily tell anyone brings subject travel insurance experience save moneyyou may need nonlocal transporation

sevencorners,"Seven Corners advertises coverage on their website and pamphlets that sound perfect. Then they sell you a package underwritten by another company. That company applies their rules. The first 5 pages of the insurance packet makes the coverage seem perfect.Then, on page 20, there are fine print details in legalese that exclude anything possible.They will ask for supporting documents, and lead you on for weeks. IF you manage to succeed with filing a claim, they will then bring up fine print and claim you aren't covered for it. So why ask me for all the supporting documents for something that isn't covered? Why waste six weeks of my time?This is racketeering by definition. You are given the illusion of choice, while in actuality they are running a racket. You do not have choice and their product is not what you think you are buying. One big bamboozle.They will send you a form letter ""signed"" by a claims specialist with their phone number at the bottom. The phone number takes you to the main 1-800 line, and they will tell you it is impossible to speak to H****** ******* - despite denying my claim and putting her name on a letter about it. So they either ""gate keep"" or lie as part of the racket. The ""license number"" ""H******"" uses is for the company, Seven Corners. There is no person by that name licensed in the state she claims.They advertise ""X coverage up to $5,000"", and that their medical policies cover more than just medical.

sevencorners,"I strongly urge you to steer clear of this company. I had trip insurance for a trip to Maui that we had to cancel due to the wildfires. I managed to cancel and receive refunds from every entity, including the airline, VRBO rental, rental damage insurance, car rental, every excursion/activity we had planned and prepaid, etc. You get the idea. However, Seven Corners refused to cancel our trip insurance although they would have had to pay me thousands of dollars for the legitimate trip cancellation as I had paid for an ""any reason"" cancellation. However, under the circumstances, each entity gave me a 100% refund although we were outside the cancellation time for the airline and condo rental, which was the significant portion of what the loss would have been. It is outrageous that Seven Corners lacked empathy and disallowed me to cancel the policy under this situation. For full disclosure, they did offer to ""suspend"" the insurance to allow me to apply it WITHIN 1 YEAR, in case we reschedule out trip. I tried to explain that does me no good since our plans were in West Maui, specifically in Lahaina, which will NOT be rebuilt within a year. I trust they will reply to this review with something about the terms of the policy not allowing a cancellation, but I remind everyone reading this that Delta Airlines and VRBO could have invoked their non-cancellation terms also and forced me into a credit situation.

sevencorners,"am surprised by all reviews and have clear doubts it is even accurate I suggest looking for BBB reviews.experience with Seven Corner Insurance Company,which has left me feeling deeply dissatisfied and concerned about their practices.Since January 2023, I have been attempting to settle a claim with Seven Corner Insurance Company, but to my dismay, they have continuously delayed the process by repeatedly asking for additional documents. I have dutifully submitted all the required documentation, but they seem to have made no effort to respond or address my concerns. Their lack of communication and unresponsiveness have left me frustrated and anxious about the status of my claim.I have tried reaching out to them via email and phone calls numerous times, but my attempts have been met with silence. It is disheartening to see such a lack of concern for their customers, especially when they are obligated to provide the services they have promised.As a last resort, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) in the hopes that it would prompt a response from Seven Corner Insurance Company. However, even the BBB complaint has not elicited any reply from the company. My research on the BBB website has further revealed that my experience is not an isolated incident, as there are other customers facing similar issues with the company. It is distressing to see Seven Corner listed as a company with multiple complaints and no resolution, despite their claims of being the best insurance company, as highlighted on their website with a Forbes award in 2023.I firmly believe that consumers should be protected from such fraudulent practices, and it is imperative that authorities step in to safeguard our rights as consumers. Misleading promises and lack of accountability from insurance companies can have severe consequences for individuals who rely on their services to protect themselves and their families.I kindly request your intervention in this matter and urge you to investigate the actions of Seven Corner Insurance Company thoroughly. They should be held accountable for their misleading practices, lack of responsiveness, and failure to fulfill their obligations to their customers, as outlined in their policy agreements.MOST ANNOYING THAT YOU WILL FIND THE COMPANY WILL RESPOND TO ANY REVIEW LIKE(I will put in an escalation request to look into your claims.

sevencorners,"We traveled to Croatia in October 22 and had to cut our trip short after self testing 3 times for COVID. With no rooms left at hotel to stay in place and travel with the group no longer an option our travel agent got us a flight to return home. We immediately filed a claim and were told to expect to hear within 90 days. After 90 days and multiple calls/delays we were told the claim would be escalated. After approximately 110 days we filed a complaint with our state insurance commission. After hearing from the commissioner 7 Corners contacted our travel agent who was asked who made the decision to terminate our travels. She indicated she had due to the lack of medical help available. The result was a quick response denying our claim, indicating we did not get an in-country medical diagnosis prior to leaving. At that time all special COVID testing sites both in the city and at the airport had been shut down. We immediately contacted our Primary Physicians once returning and quarantined. 7 Corners then pointed to the policy's clause that a medical professional diagnosis was required prior to leaving our trip. Bottom line: 120 days later, no one at 7 Corners would direct us to a supervisor, claim denied after many efforts to speak to someone about the claim and delays only to get a perfunctory denial. We do not feel that 7 Corners ever gave our claim a serious review and found a clause to cancel after hearing from the Insurance Commissioner. Per their policy, they had the right to deny but did not require 120 days and the run around, delays and no consideration of the COVID circumstances.I am adding the following as an edit since you offered no “reply” option,My post was not about time to getting an answer. It was about the failure to speak forthrightly and the denial during the COVID period when norms were severely impacted, including the availability of medical services while nearly everyone had access to self testing and instructions to quarantine unless symptoms were severe.You reply is as insulting as our experience attempting to get some consideration for our loss while insured by 7 Corners.Allow me to make a specific ask.

I suppose they can use the excuse that they needed my cc statements and not just paid invoices, but they didn't ASK for them until 2+ months into it, which leads me to recommend that some first-tier person check claims upon receipt to see if something is missing, or in this case -- PUT ON THE CLAIM FORM to include CC statements.  (Perhaps it's something used to justify stretching out the claim response.)  It's a large amount ($20K), and I know they've got staffing issues.    I just hope this isn't being dragged out because they're strapped for cash.  And if that's the case -- that their liabilities are covered in case of a bankruptcy.

Although only $61, which I had paid for in cash, I thought I'd submit it. They kept asking for more and more proof beyond the detailed hospital bills marked paid, such as proof from the airline I was in the country. Then they asked me to fill out forms that had nothing to do with my claim, such as regarding travel interruption, which was not my claim. Then they said - and this is an exact quote - ""We will try to resolve your claim in 130 days."" Are you kidding? Four+ months after I invested so much time with emails and paperwork for a stinking $61? I think they just make you do more and more until you give up.

sevencorners,"I purchased trip insurance in December with the Cancel for Any Reason clause for a March trip.  My surgeon has told me I cannot start the March trip until I complete 1 extra week of Physical therapy, and therefore, the first three nights of my nonrefundable vacation rental can't be used.Seven Corners argues that there is NO coverage for the 3-night MEDICAL delay as it is not ""interruption,"" not ""delayed"" as the trip didn't start, and not canceled as I will be making the rest of the trip.  So NO Claim is possible even with medical necessity/form.Also, if I filed a claim for those first three nights, the rest of the trip is NOT covered as 1 claim voids out coverage for the rest of the trip I can make.They offered to let me buy a NEW policy for my new dates if I were to file a claim, which they indicated would be denied anyway.  Or the other option is just don't file a claim (absorb the 3-night non-refundable), and then they can adjust the policy to start the trip three days later, which I can then fully cancel if I want.The logic escapes me as the entire trip amount is 10X the price of 3 nights.  All the agent could do was read and read and read the same line and say the trip didn't begin, so no claim was covered or acceptable.Great options? I think the loopholes are stacked against all reasonable consumers, and medical notes should be honored under the DELAY (not just airport weather delays and flight cancelations).Seven Corners?... my last choice for the future.Update 3/4/23...

Their excuse is covid but if you’re going to charge people for a service and can’t handle the influx of claims, you shouldn’t be handling travel insurance.They’re not a scam and have been fine when they responded, but I never used them to completion when I needed them and gratefully I didn’t have to use them while on my trip because they would’ve been so frustrating and unhelpful.Update: I just wanted to add to my review after the seven corners’ response because saying you’re going to follow up, doesn’t negate my underlying feedback and review. I said the response time and overall coverage was inadequate, which I still believe it is. Saying you’re going to follow up to publicly appease viewers is poor form and to be clear, a customer advocate did not follow up and since seven corners seems to respond faster to reviews than it’s actual customers, I won’t be moving forward with my claim.

sevencorners,"Never with this Seven Corners again. We insured a combination trip to Germany and Greece. We had 2 independent claims, one was a missed connection flight due to a severe storm, which is covered per policy, and secondly, a trip interruption with cancelation of the vacation in Greece due to my husband getting sick in Germany and being admitted to the hospital through the emergency room. Seven Corners declined ALL claims. While I can accept that they deny the cancellation and trip fees for the Greece-part of our trip, because we canceled from Germany, because my husband didn't feel well and we didn't consult with a physician prior to cancellation, there is no reason why the medical expense was denied, and also why the costs for our missed connection flight on the way to Germany was denied. Upon asking for an explanation- I just received a general statement, not even addressing why the medical expense itself and the second independent claims was denied, and giving me psychological support for denying the claim. Stay away from Seven Corner! They cheat you!Update: Seven Corners responded to this review saying that they look at my claim again and an advocate will contact me.

sevencorners,"I submitted my travel claim 7/8/2022. My experience with Seven Corners has been absolutely terrible. I plan to describe it on social media so that others can understand and avoid the frustration I have been through. I filed my claim almost 5 months ago!Since then I have spent countless hours with Seven Corners customer service trying to get my claim processed. I even asked to have it expedited for financial reasons. Nothing.For starters, I spent several weeks communicating and sending documentation to wrong companies who had received my claim. It seemed my claim was being sent  around to several wrong companies, perhaps a Starr Insurance (?) and then 2 other companies called Squaremouth and Broadspire.  I spent hours filling out my claim information on these incorrect online sites, sending followup emails and speaking with their service reps.I was then told by a company, perhaps Starr,  to contact Seven Corners, again sending all my documentation to your site. After going back and forth regarding details of my submittal, including the absence of my bank's logo on my online bank statement, which the bank does not provide, I was assured I would get my refund in early October.When I called, about the 8th time for a status, I was told I needed to sign a ""Disclosure to Release Funds"" which I was asked to send as, surprisingly, hadn't been sent. Had I not called, I probably would still be waiting for it. I returned it and heard nothing but ""You will receive an email notice when we send your check.""Last week I sent another email to check on the status and received an email that ""we need the member's date of birth"". This seems like a series of innocuous requests from you company, over 5 months, to avoid payment. Pretty sure with all the documentation you have on hand from myself and John Handcock, whom you represent, that you already have that information.From my dealings in the business world , my experience here has been absolutely horrendous. I've heard excuses due to ""long refund times"" from Seven Corners, using COVID as an excuse, understaffing, etc. You would certainly think a company would increase their staff due to anticipation of increased claims from COVID.I plan to share this most frustrating and time-consuming experience, starting with Facebook and Yelp, for both John Hancock and Seven Corners.

sevencorners,"Unfortunately, I must agree with the negative reviews for this company.I have used Square Mouth to purchase cruise travel insurance for years and have always purchased the same policy.  As most of the positive reviews here state, the purchase itself was easy and smooth.  Having to file my first ever claim to be reimbursed a small amount of money ($1430) because I tested positive for COVID after getting off a ship in Vancouver which prevented me from flying home, has been a disaster in terms of dealing with Seven Corners.The claim was filed on 5/22/22 with all the required documentation.  Made double sure to include everything requested, outlined it, highlighted it and everything was straightforward.Waited 30 days before first follow-up via e-mail.  Received a response telling me they were ""upset about the wait time too"" and ""to be assured my claim would be reviewed"" and they would ""e-mail me every 3 weeks with an update on my claim.""Over the course of the next few MONTHS I had be the initiator for follow-up and only then would I get the same ""form"" e-mail telling me the the exact same information.Finally on 9/14/22 I received a different request.  They now wanted a copy of my credit card statement showing I had, in fact, paid the charges submitted.  That was the only thing requested and I sent this information back via e-mail the same day.From that point - radio silence.  Reached out several times over the next few weeks and couldn't even warrant a reply of the standard ""form"" e-mail telling me they were ""upset about the wait time too.""Finally I reached out to Square Mouth, the 3rd party vendor I purchased the policy through.  They have a ""Zero Complaint"" department to assist with just such issues.  I scheduled a phone meeting with one of Square Mouth's ""Zero Complaint"" representatives.  We had our conversation on 11/2/22 and she stated she would send a follow-up request to Seven Corners.I know this will sound unbelievable but Seven Corners actually sent an email to me within 48 hours - denying my claim.The money is not the issue, it's not a large amount.  The aggravating part is they only responded after I got Square Mouth involved, and then apparently decided quickly to just deny and move on.The reason for denying was due to me not going to a physician (in Vancouver) and getting diagnosed with COVID and then having said physician ""restrict"" my travel.  Seriously Seven Corners?  The UNITED STATED OF AMERICA CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL had a mandate in place back in May which clearly stated if you tested positive for COVID within one (1) day of a scheduled flight into the United States, you were NOT allowed to fly into the United States and would be denied boarding.  I didn't need a physician to restrict me, the U.S. Government did.  I did, however, submit a video proctored COVID test which confirmed my positive results.   Further, why did Seven Corners request a copy of my credit card statement if this is the reason behind them denying my claim?  Doesn't make a lot of sense.So, to control costs (i.e. 10 day hotel bill for quarantine), I booked travel from Vancouver to Seattle via bus, as land borders had no restrictions for entering the U.S., and I changed my flight from Vancouver to Seattle (domestic flights did not require tests).  I double-masked up and got home without having a huge bill to file with, what I thought was, my quality travel insurance plan.  Instead what I got from them was nothing.  Lesson learned.Sorry for such a long post, but consumers deserve to know what others go through with a company.  If you're fair, you deserve praise and good reviews.

Last week I spoke with a manager and he stated the claim was in claims manager review and I should expect a response via email within 1-2 days.  Again, nothing.

sevencorners,"The educational tour company my daughter was going on a school trip with made it mandatory to show a negative PCR covid test to fly. My daughter tested positive days before the trip. I emailed Seven Corners a few times asking if they needed anything other than what was on the list they provided me and that I had sent them. My daughter was asymptomatic, the covid numbers were high, and everyone was told NOT to go to the doctor unless they needed to. I called Seven Corners and asked if my daughter needed to see a doctor for insurance reasons. I was told that she did NOT need to see a doctor because no matter what a doctor said, she still would not be allowed to fly. I submitted the insurance claim immediately. The time frames given proceeded to get longer and longer. It's now been 5 months and I received a denial letter stating she was denied because she didn't see a doctor. They had only been talking to me, her mom, for the entire 5 months. After I said I was going to make a formal complaint, they said they needed to verify me. Then they said they couldn’t speak to me unless my daughter, who was a minor when we got the insurance, signed a form stating they could talk to me. In the meantime, I reached out to my daughter's teacher and explained the situation. They responded to her saying, “Our Traveler Support Team has processed Clarice’s claim and is refunding $4,070.” They never asked the teacher to get authorization. When I reached out to them regarding what the teacher showed me, they denied me again. Simply put, this company is immoral. ***The insurance was taken out BEFORE covid was a thing. And we know that covid changed everything. Which is why when I called the insurance company and spoke to an agent I said, Is there anything else I need to do? Does my daughter need to see a doctor for insurance reasons? Because she can't go no matter what. Seeing the doctor makes no difference. The rep responded with, exactly. No she does not need to see a doctor. The PCR test is the only thing needed. This was during a time when covid numbers were high and the United States government asked that people who tested positive for covid, that were not seriously ill, NOT take up space so more sick people could be seen. This was the government asking. And I STILL asked Seven Corners if I should take my daughter in. Seven Corners said that I did NOT need to have my daughter seen. I don't think listening to the government and also double checking with the insurance company should result in my claim being denied.",1.0,educational tour company daughter going school trip made mandatory show negative pcr covid test fly daughter tested positive day trip emailed seven corner time asking needed anything list provided sent daughter asymptomatic covid number high everyone told go doctor unless needed called seven corner asked daughter needed see doctor insurance reason told need see doctor matter doctor said still would allowed fly submitted insurance claim immediately time frame given proceeded get longer longer month received denial letter stating denied didnt see doctor talking mom entire month said going make formal complaint said needed verify said couldnt speak unless daughter minor got insurance signed form stating could talk meantime reached daughter teacher explained situation responded saying traveler support team processed clarices claim refunding never asked teacher get authorization reached regarding teacher showed denied simply put company immoral insurance taken covid thing know covid changed everything called insurance company spoke agent said anything else need daughter need see doctor insurance reason cant go matter seeing doctor make difference rep responded exactly need see doctor pcr test thing needed time covid number high united state government asked people tested positive covid seriously ill take space sick people could seen government asking still asked seven corner take daughter seven corner said need daughter seen dont think listening government also double checking insurance company result claim denied

sevencorners,"Note that almost all the four and five star reviews here are from people who got a policy but who didn't need to make a claim. The one star reviews are from those of us who actually tried to file and collect on a claim. It took Seven Corners over four months to decide to deny my two claims. The reasons for they gave for denial are worth noting, should you consider purchasing a travel policy from them.My first claim was for expenses incurred when my outbound international flight was canceled less than 24 hours prior to departure. As a result I was charged for a no-show at my hotel. However, my claim was denied solely because I had prepaid for my hotel. Per my denial letter ""your Trip Delay coverage only covers Reasonable Expenses that were a direct result of the delay and had nothing to do with any pre-paid expenses like the hotel that charged you no-show fees.""My second claim was based on contracting Covid while on my trip. As a result I was unable to return as scheduled and had to pay for flight change fees and additional nights at a hotel until I tested negative and could board a plane - ironically, the precise situation for which I got insurance!

My travel from the UK to France was derailed when France closed its borders to all tourists coming from the UK because of Covid. I bought a ticket back home to the US, and then sent all the receipts and information to Seven Corners, including screenshots of the news headlines about the border closing and all tourist travel being suspended. Nine months later, I still have not received any reimbursement from Seven Corners - the opposite - they closed my case instead! At first they sent automated e-mails just asking for the same documents over and over, and I kept re-sending them. No one could tell me what - if anything - was missing, only that I should keep re-sending the documents. And then finally they just closed my case. No one responds to my email follow-ups. When I call them, no customer representatives can provide me with any information - I've spoken to different representatives each time, and each one of them said they don't know the people reviewing my case, and there is no way to escalate or contact them. In the end, Seven Corners has wasted my time and money, has provided no helpful information, no reimbursement, and no way to escalate. It was an enormous waste of money and feels like fraud. I imagine Seven Corners will do the same to you as well - I would stay far away from them.Update: Seven Corners finally responded right after I posted this review.

sevencorners,"I canceled my trip as my mother was at a critical stage with her leukemia and I am her primary caregiver.   Also, my husband was finishing treatment for prostate cancer so we could have filed a claim for that reason too.  I did the claim so as not to burden my husband with all the claims submission work. . Additionally, I purchased the ""cancel for any reason"" as a ""just in case"" our destination had an uptick in Covid at our destination & did not want to risk going.  I thought I had covered my bases.    I was told that either one of the health reasons were covered & I did not need to file 2 claims as both of us were covered by either health issue & one claim was sufficient.  Both my husband & I had purchased this same plan.  I filed a claim on April 8th.  I actually talked with an agent as I filled out the form to be sure I did it correctly and submitted all the info including letter from the Dr., and receipts on my credit card as proof of payments {which took an enormous amount of time as I had to cover all the other purchases on my cc statement & my personal information on every page that I then copied & submitted) , a letter from the travel company stating that they have a ""no refund"" policy & no future credit towards another trip. Because of their policy, the travel company advised us to get travel insurance & gave us the company that they recommend who is reputable & responsive. When I asked the Travel Co. to write a letter for this claim, they asked if I had gone with their recommended insurance company as claims are processed & paid within 30 days.  I am so sorry I had not used the company they recommended.  I am having the same problems with Seven Corners that all the bad reviews have covered.  Great service when you purchased the policy but horrible when you make a claim.   Long waits on phone trying to reach a representative if you even get through. No returned phone calls after leaving my number on recorded message that said they would call me back & keep me in order of the calls received. Excuses that they are so backlogged so all claims take 90 days ect.  In over this 2 1/2 month period,I received a digi-sign document on May 1, 5, 10 & the last one June 13 that was THE SAME CLAIMS forms I had already filled out and submitted via fax. I was able to get through twice in May & asked why I was getting these forms & told that it must be a mistake that they had all the documents & the claim was being processed & not to be concerned. ( On April 19, I received an email saying the 13 pages were received  & a claims advisor would contact me if any more info needed which never happened).  When I received the one on June 13, I opened it again and ran my cursor over the pages  just to see what would happen.  On each line of the form including my name & case number, OPTIONAL displayed.  Really!! You send a Docu-sign claims form repeatedly but it's optional to fill in the information????   After waiting on the phone for 40 minutes, I was told the same thing.  They don't know why I received it, there were no notes that they needed more info, & it was pending.  and maybe it was a computer problem on their end!  Really!!!  I said this is more than just some glitch and they needed to find out from someone in charge what was going on.   I'm still waiting to hear back from that ""someone""   I tried another number that was given me and it was a recorded message saying I was being offered a medic alert device as a special offer!

sevencorners,"Seven Corners insurance is as close to fraud as I've ever experienced. I purchased this insurance for a stay in the United State hoping to not have to use it. Unfortunately, due to circumstances outside of my control, I had to. I wish I never had.I was extremely diligent with keeping Seven Corners in the loop every step of the way, and they assured me that they had me covered as long as a followed the steps they outlined, which I did. Weeks later when bills began to roll in, I discovered that was all a lie.Seven Corners has denied all of my claims and is trying to stick me with $20,000 in hospital, doctor, and test bills -- prices which even the doctors involved said ""could not be possible"" given what the visits entailed. Seven Corners blamed the doctors' staff and claimed visits were 'missing information' or were for reasons other than the actual purpose of my visit to the doctor. I've gone on to spend countless stressful hours appealing my denied claims and sourcing information/documents to submit to Seven Corners to support my claims (something that is their job). If I am stuck with these bills I will have no choice but to declare bankruptcy.I feel completely abandoned by Seven Corners -- a company I paid a hefty price ($1000) to be insured. They have completely lost my trust and you should avoid them at all costs because they're going to stick you with the bill no matter what.The people that run this company should be ashamed of themselves.

sevencorners,"I purchased travel insurance - including the Cancel for Any Reason (CFAR) rider - for a February trip that had to be cancelled due to Covid.

The ninety days came and went with no updates, so I posted a couple of comments on Seven Corners' Facebook page stating my intention to start a complaint with my state's Insurance Department. The Seven Corners social-media team evidently prodded the claims department to get cracking - I received two communications within a few days stating that the claim was finally being processed, and then on May 16, a note that payment for about 93% of the reimbursement amount I requested would be mailed, which I could expect to receive within ""ten working days.""

What counts is whether the company lived up to their promise, if they made claim processing easy, and reimbursements painless. Well, I had to contact Seven Corners on 2 occasions (one was a medical emergency evacuation, the other was a 24 hour flight delay). They failed miserably on both fronts. Calling from a foreign country, it takes over an hour to get an agent on the phone (same for whatsapp). Then, they conveniently denied all claims, even though my policy specifically states that medical emergency evacuations, as well as trip interruption costs are covered. They simply asked me to go to the airline, and said they would cover only $100 per day, even though the policy states $500 per day. What recourse do I have? None. Just stay away from this fraudulent company. It's infuriating how companies like this can be in business, very quick to take your money, and then they simply want you to disappear.PS: The company replied that mountaineering was not covered under my policy. It clearly was, even though I wasn't mountaineering! High altitude trekking was labeled as a Hazardous activity, and I specifically purchased coverage for it. Also, Travel Delay was covered up to $500, but they replied that it was $100. What a joke of a company. Good luck getting in touch with them should you really need them.

The day before our return trip, I tested positive resulting in delay and additional expenses.    It took me 7 hours to get a hold of Seven Corners.   I phoned several times trying various options, I emailed all email addresses I could find.    Finally an agent called back and said she could provide a claim from as well as a few medical referals for Budapest.   She also advised for  a claim to possibly be reviewed, it was required to have positive PCR test even though US regulations accept antigen test.   Also required was a Physician's Statement.   She also did not know if the claim would be for Trip Delay or Trip Interruption.   I felt there was very little help/assistance.

sevencorners,"On January 3-,2021 I purchased a travel policy for my husband Philip Williamson and myself for two cruises and air departing Feb 17 and returning March 13,2022. Policy # 9RTC19-28221.  I had to cancel our trip on Nov 19 due to being admitted to the hospital on Nov 2,2021 and still receiving treatment.I filed a claim (# 01917609) on Nov 19th. I mailed all documents via USPS which Seven Corners signed for Dec 24th. I called the end of January to see where in the process I was, but not able to get thru so I went on line and noticed nothing was there. I called and spoke with Candace and was told there was no claim in there system so she gave me a new claim number (#14711076).  Shortly after she called me and said they had found the original claim and she would expedite the claim. A few weeks later I went on line again and found that they needed more information from Royal Cruise Line.  Which I had explained to  an agent that RCL would not give me anything in writing but gave me cancelation numbers.  On Feb 2nd I submitted what information I had from RCL and advised Seven Corners per Jenny at RCL customer service that Seven Corners needed to contact them for the information at 800-327-6700.  I waited a few more weeks and contacted Seven Corners again and was told nobody had done anything with my claim. They would sent it to the claims adjuster again. Again I waited for weeks, I went on line and it showed I needed to send medical information and RCL info to them which I had done twice before.    I called and said it had been sent twice.  On March 18th I called and reach Kyle and he proceeded to go over everything and he knew I was very upset at this point. He contacted two managers David and Johnathan and I was told they would get this processed and I would receive a call back no later than yesterday March 21.  Again no return call, not really surprised!  Today I called and spoke with Kelly G (who went above and beyond her job).  I explained what was happening and she verified notes in the record. She tried to reach a manager but was unable to.  She decided to call Royal Caribbean directly even though that is not her job but she understood my frustration and what good customer service is.  She spoke with them and they told her they couldn't give her anything but then agreed to email claim department and me with the cancelation information. It would take up to a month for them to send it.  I was totally surprised when Kelly told me that Seven Corners never contacted RCL for 16 days after I gave them the information and was told they would handle it immediately.I was a travel agent for 35 yrs and would never be able to recommend your company again.  But prior to the recent service I used your company along with recommending you to our traveling companies for another policy.  I feel I must contact AARP which is who recommended your company.  I prefer not to contact my attorney or Facebook to advise customers.  When someone is sick and recovering they don't need to be trying to deal with these issues which good customer service should be handle.RegardsDebra MacJennett-WilliamsonHello, On March 22 I wrote a review of Seven Corners which wasn't positive.

Instead of stating that the coverage was for Covid, quarentining, hospital, ER, etc., it was a tick list highlighting what I DIDN'T purchase - all of the extras I didn't opt for - cancellation insurace, flight reimbursement, hotel costs, etc. etc. etc.  There was a slight mention of ""Covid"" at the bottom of the initial paragraph, and nothing else.  It was underwhelming.

sevencorners,"We paid in full and were sold a cancellation insurance policy for my son's trip through EF Explore who canceled the trips twice despite other people still traveling during this time. 2 years later my son no longer attends the school and EF only wants to offer a voucher for the full amount. They refunded all but $350 and told me directly that I would need to file a claim for all but the registration I paid them from Seven Corners and the policy amount for trip insurance for the $150. I filed a claim in early October. On October 20 I finally received a response they needed more information which was sent immediately. I did not get a response until I reached out on their Facebook post about their family game room with a ping pong table in mid January. They said Covid made things busy to promptly respond to claims (I think ping pong was the culprit) and they promptly denied they claim as fast as they took my money stating that the child no longer at the school qualified as a cancellation covered. They did  not respond for months and when a review was left they responded with a denied claim and money not refunded is for work that we never received the benefits from. What I was told by EF was not what was sold to me. Between the coordinated effort between the two companies, they make the process as difficult as possible so you will give up.

sevencorners,"Seven corners reviewIf I could give 0 (zero) stars I would!  We purchased this for a 2021 trip to Belize.  I fell and shattered my wrist on the third day we were on the island of Ambergris Caye in Belize.  We contacted Seven Corners immediately.  They said I’d be covered for anything related to the incident for 180 days past the date of the initial incident.  And possibly longer (with authorization). So far all they covered was the airplane tickets home (which Delta would have done for us anyway!). When we called they kept telling us our coverage was terminated on May 10, 2021.  We KNEW that!  However, we’ve had substantial bills after arriving back in the USA.  My surgery was on May 7, 2021 (which was still before expiration of the initial plan coverage dates).  Seven Corners even denied charges that occurred on May 7.  We were given a contact representative concerning the claims.  Not only has nothing been paid, but after several messages, the assigned representative has not returned our calls!!!  The hospitals and doctors connected to the treatments have had no responses and/or received denials due to “terminated insurance”?!?!  No one will return our calls/messages!!  If we didn’t have other health insurance we would be BANKRUPT!  As it is, we’ve had to pay thousands of dollars worth of bills that Seven Corners should have paid OUT OF OUR POCKET!  The Seven Corners policy isn’t worth the “paper it’s written on” or the time we spent enrolling online!!We travel extensively and purchase travelers insurance allot!  WE WILL NOT PURCHASE SEVEN CORNERS TRAVEL INSURANCE AGAIN.  And we will give the same recommendation to the groups we travel with.",1.0,seven corner reviewif could give zero star would purchased trip belize fell shattered wrist third day island ambergris caye belize contacted seven corner immediately said id covered anything related incident day past date initial incident possibly longer authorization far covered airplane ticket home delta would done u anyway called kept telling u coverage terminated may knew however weve substantial bill arriving back usa surgery may still expiration initial plan coverage date seven corner even denied charge occurred may given contact representative concerning claim nothing paid several message assigned representative returned call hospital doctor connected treatment response andor received denial due terminated insurance one return callsmessages didnt health insurance would bankrupt weve pay thousand dollar worth bill seven corner paid pocket seven corner policy isnt worth paper written time spent enrolling onlinewe travel extensively purchase traveler insurance allot purchase seven corner travel insurance give recommendation group travel

sevencorners,"These guys are just awful. At the beginning of the pandemic I purchased cancel for any reason travel insurance. They refused to pay out on lodging for “Cancel For Any Reason” claim. The VRBO owner offered me a non-refundable credit, so in other words the only way I could be compensated was to reschedule a trip I no longer wanted to take. That is NOT Cancel For Any Reason”! The policy actually said “We will pay You for the following: (a) The amount of forfeited, non-refundable, and unused Payments or Deposits”. The VRBOs offer of a non-refundable credit is none of those things. Seven Corners cheated me by “interpreting “ the policy language to include things that clearly aren’t there. Again, how are you compensated for a cancelled trip if you have to reschedule the trip to not lose out?",1.0,guy awful beginning pandemic purchased cancel reason travel insurance refused pay lodging cancel reason claim vrbo owner offered nonrefundable credit word way could compensated reschedule trip longer wanted take cancel reason policy actually said pay following amount forfeited nonrefundable unused payment deposit vrbos offer nonrefundable credit none thing seven corner cheated interpreting policy language include thing clearly arent compensated cancelled trip reschedule trip lose
