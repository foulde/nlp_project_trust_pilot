AARDY,"My very first contact with AARDY was this past summer. I was impressed with how the representative was doing his best to find a solution even though we determined that AARDY did not have a plan that suited my needs. (I also needed personal liability included in the travel medical which is an uncommon pairing in the US as I learned.) But even though I didn't purchase anything from AARDY that time, the rep left a positive impression on me!So today as I was preparing for another trip (for which I do not need personal liability), I remembered AARDY and went to the company website. From the chat with Sarah via the website to the phone calls with Nicole all the way to the final emails, I felt the process was seamless!During our webchat, Sarah also offered to have someone call us in case that was helpful.When Nicole called us, she was able to understand our concerns and highlight the corresponding features of the plan proposed for us so that we didn't need to buy more insurance than we needed. Sometimes one can feel overwhelmed with all the benefits and coverage components, but thanks to Nicole, I felt like I understood what I needed to know. I also appreciated that travelers in two different age categories could be handled within the same plan.The lookback period of the plan they proposed is less than some of the other plans out there so that's worth keeping in mind if you are looking for travel medical insurance.When we made our final decision, it was wonderful to call back and be able to conclude the purchase with Nicole.
